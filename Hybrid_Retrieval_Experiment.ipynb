In light of technolog\\xad\\nical innovations in “CASE,”* the very concept of the automobile is on the verge of major change. Given this situa\\xad\\ntion, we must transform our business model into one that is in line with the CASE era.\\nTransforming the Business Model for the CASE Era\\nAs we make changes to our business model, it is crucial that we go back to the basics, that is, our roots, to \\nre-examine the role Toyota should play and consider how we should proceed, for example, in the advancement \\nin electrification. Given that people can only contribute to the environment when eco-friendly technologies are \\nwidely used, we realized that we need to embrace fresh ideas and new ways of thinking.\\nTherefore, rather than focus solely on passenger cars and individual customers, we can spread these technolo\\xad\\ngies via commercial vehicles and vehicles for government offices and fleet customers. Rather than conduct \\ndevelopment on our own—without friends and partners—we can partner and collaborate with others who share \\nour aspirations. Rather than keep our patents to ourselves, we can open them up and create more new friends. \\nRather than sell only cars, we can provide various services in which vehicles are incorporated into a system and \\nfocus more broadly and openly on contributing to the improvement of society.  \\nIn other words, we recognized that the path to a new business model could only be reached by transforming our \\nways of thinking. \\nFrom now, information will link all items and services that support people’s daily lives. Considering this, we will \\nstrive to adopt a broad, community-level and society-level perspective that includes cars, which in essence is the \\nconcept of the “connected city.”\\nIn May 2019, we reached an agreement with Panasonic Corporation toward the establishment of a new joint \\nventure to advance “town development” with the shared goal of creating new lifestyle value for communities as a \\nwhole. Building on the housing businesses of both companies, we are dedicated to the challenge of providing \\nnew kinds of lifestyles by bringing together the strengths of Toyota, with its vehicle and connected businesses, \\nand Panasonic, with its home appliance, battery, and IoT businesses.\\n* CASE refers to the new areas of “Connected,” “Autonomous/Automated,” “Shared,” and “Electric.”\\n2\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nMessage from the President\\nToward a Future Centered on People\\nFrom the perspective of the connected city, it is clear that Toyota will not be able to survive the coming era on \\nour own, nor just by focusing solely on cars. We need “friends” with whom we can pool our strengths to mutually \\nstrengthen our competitiveness. At the same time, alongside the development of CASE technologies, automa\\xad\\ntion is gradually advancing across society.\\nIn this era of “making friends,” namely building alliances, and this era of automation, I believe that insights into how \\nwe can battle for survival in this era can be found in the Toyota Production System (TPS), Toyota’s very bedrock.\\nToyota’s roots extend back to the automatic loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda. The greatest feature of this loom \\nwas that it would automatically stop if a single thread broke. I see in this the origin of not only Toyota’s dedication \\nto preventing the production of defective products, but also our belief that we should not make people into mere \\nmachine overseers. At Toyota, we call this approach “intelligent automation,” or “automation centered on people.”\\nKiichiro Toyoda, who launched automobile production, added the idea of making only what is needed, when it is \\nneeded, and in the amount needed to the idea of automation with people. This approach, which we call “Just-in-\\nTime,” amounts to the ultimate in sincerely anticipating and fulfilling customer needs, staying just a bit ahead of \\ntheir expectations. \\nThese two concepts—automation with people and Just-in-Time—are the pillars of the TPS. What both have in \\ncommon is that people are at the center.\\nI believe that the more automation advances, the more the ability of the people using it will be put to the test. \\nMachines cannot improve unless people do, too. Developing people with skills that can equal machines and \\nsenses that surpass sensors is a fundamental part of Toyota’s approach.\\nIn addition, the crucial factor in making friends is people. In other words, effective partnerships and alliances are \\nnot necessarily formed by the logic of capital or numbers. Only through connections formed between people \\nwho share aspirations, understanding, and trust can we create the future together.\\n3\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nMessage from the President\\nUnwavering Commitment to the Development of Our People \\nToyota believes that “monozukuri (manufacturing) is about developing people.” This philosophy has always \\nserved as the basis of how we develop our people. As we enter this once-in-a-century period of profound trans\\xad\\nformation, I believe we should renew once again our focus on the effective development of our people. \\nThis autumn, in a message to employees, I spoke about two key strengths that will be indispensable to surviving \\nin the coming era.\\nThe first strength is a “competitiveness unique to Toyota,” which is TPS and our ability to refine costs while \\nrelentlessly pursuing the ideal balance between quality and cost. The leaders of Toyota including Kiichiro Toyoda \\nworked earnestly to build ever-better cars with the desire to serve our society, our customers, and someone \\nother than ourselves. A constant Kaizen (continuous improvement) mindset is the spirit of TPS itself, and rep\\xad\\nresents the values that Toyota has long treasured. Regaining these values is what I see as corporate culture \\nreform, reform that will obliterate the “concept of non-crisis,” I believe. \\nThe second strength, “compassion,” is the ability to understand and respect the positions and thinking of others \\nand to get them on board. At the meeting, I spoke about the Five Main Principles of Toyoda and called for a \\nreturn to the spirit of Toyota’s founding. This is because I believe that these main principles exemplify the com\\xad\\npassion and strength of character necessary to survive the coming era. \\nPeople who possess these two strengths—competitiveness unique to Toyota and compassion—are best devel\\xad\\noped in front-line operations. To equip ourselves for the transformational period in which we find ourselves, we \\nwill therefore return to “prioritizing real-world” experiences at the genba (on the front lines), and putting our fullest \\nefforts into developing the people who will build the future.\\n I hope you will look forward to the future of Toyota, and I ask for your continued confidence and support.\\nDecember 2019\\nAkio Toyoda\\nPresident, Member of the Board of Directors\\nToyota Motor Corporation\\n4\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nRecent Initiatives\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\nTechnological innovations known as CASE* are on the verge of changing the very concept of the automobile.

For precisely that rea\\xad\\nson, however, we have to be mindful of what must \\nnot change—namely, we must continue to hone our \\ncompetitiveness in the real world of car making. This \\nalone will allow us to generate the resources needed \\nto weather the changes to come and shift \\nmanagement resources to make even more appeal\\xad\\ning cars for the coming era. \\n\\u2003 Toyota’s car making is distinguished by its volume—\\nproducing and selling more than 10,000,000 units \\nper year globally—and its full lineup, ranging from \\ncompact to full-size cars and commercial vehicles, \\neco-cars, and GR sports cars. We are leveraging \\nthese distinctions through two key initiatives. The first \\nis Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA), aimed at \\ngreatly enhancing the potential of cars and utilizing \\nthe advantages of scale to implement smart sharing. \\nThe second is the in-house company system, through \\nwhich are creating distinctive cars based on the \\n\\xad\\ncustomer’s perspective. Through these initiatives, \\nToyota is thoroughly applying its core strengths, the \\nToyota Production System (TPS) and its approach to \\ncost reduction, to further hone efforts to make \\never-better cars that are even more affordable. With \\nthe step beyond that—a complete business model \\nchange to a mobility company—as our unwavering \\ngoal, we are advancing a wide range of innovations.\\nOur Progress So Far\\nIt has been four years since the introduction of TNGA \\nand three years since the launch of the in-house com\\xad\\npany system. The number of models and units pro\\xad\\nduced based on these systems is growing. Beginning \\nwith the fourth-generation Prius in 2015, we have \\nsteadily expanded the range of models based on \\nTNGA, including the mid-size C-HR, full-size Crown \\nand Lexus, the Supra sports car, and the compact \\nYaris. In 2019, we have announced six such models, \\nbringing the total as of November 2019 to 19. These \\nnew models now account for approximately 40% of \\nour global vehicle sales. In particular, Toyota produces \\nand sells more than 1,000,000 Corollas per year and \\nrecently introduced a Japan-only size, different from \\nthe global model, to accommodate the nation’s roads. \\nIn addition, our RAV4—the world’s best-selling SUV \\nboasting powertrains and drive systems suited to \\nregion-specific conditions, has been reintroduced to \\nJapan with affordable pricing. Thanks in part to these \\nefforts, the RAV4 has done well among younger con\\xad\\nsumers, who are seen as less interested in cars, with \\ncustomers aged 39 and below accounting for 45% of \\nall sales.\\n\\u2003 We have also seen clear gains in competitiveness \\nunder TNGA in the areas of vehicle development and \\nproduction. Development man-hours have been \\nreduced approximately 25% thanks to improved eval\\xad\\nuation efficiency through grouping development and \\ncomponent standardization. Capital expenditures \\nrelated to model switchover is also down an average \\nof about 25% per line, as we are now able to effi\\xad\\nciently produce multiple models using the same facili\\xad\\nties due to advances in equipment and fixture \\nstandardization. Furthermore, we have reduced \\nvehicle costs approximately 10% by standardizing \\ncomponents and reducing the number of component \\ntypes as well as by revising component structures \\nand simplifying production processes through manu\\xad\\nfacturing improvement in cooperation with suppliers. \\nHowever, due in part to enhancements to environ\\xad\\nmental performance and safety features, we have not \\nyet been able to bring prices as low as customers \\nwould like. We will continue working to make cars \\nwith such features even more affordable.\\nInitiatives for a Once-in-a-century \\nPeriod of Transformation\\nThe environment surrounding car making has \\nchanged rapidly in recent years, from the tightening \\nof environmental regulations to the entry of new play\\xad\\ners from other industries and the diversification of \\nmobility businesses. Such changes are expected to \\ncontinue increasing in scope and speed, and deliver\\xad\\ning the cars that customers want via conventional \\nmethods is already growing difficult. We are currently \\nadvancing three initiatives to address these changes \\nand continue to surpass customer expectations. \\n\\u2003 The first initiative is to enhance the in-house com\\xad\\npany system. In July 2019, we established the \\nVehicle Development Center and expanded the \\nToyota ZEV Factory. At the Vehicle Development \\nCenter, we aim to further accelerate development \\nFurther enhancing the competitiveness of our car making \\nto transform into a mobility company.\\nMoritaka Yoshida\\nExecutive Vice President\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\n2015\\n2020\\nModels Introduced under the TNGA/In-house Company System\\nLC\\nCamry\\nC-HR\\nRAV4\\nAvalon\\nPrius/Prius PHV\\nCorolla Sport\\nSupra\\nYaris\\nHighlander\\nHiace\\nCorolla\\nCorolla Touring\\nCentury\\nCrown\\nJPN Taxi\\nLS\\nES\\nUX\\nCompact \\nclass\\nFull-size \\nclass\\nMid-size \\nclass\\nLexus\\nSport\\n7\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n• Seamless development/Speed up\\n(Vehicle Development Center)\\n• Differentiation based on customer perspective\\n1: Enhance the in-house company system\\n• Smart sharing across regions/models\\n• Flexible production structure\\n2: Evolution of the TNGA\\n• Home and away/alliances\\n• Competition and collaboration (safety/environment)\\n3: Build relationships with partners\\nShift resources (people, goods, money) and human resource development \\ntoward future CASE development\\nFuture Initiatives—Further Enhancing Competitiveness\\nPreventing Accidents Caused by \\nPedal Misapplication by \\nElderly Drivers \\nIn recent years, tragic accidents caused by elderly drivers \\nhave frequently appeared in the news in Japan. In particular, \\ndrivers 75 years or older are responsible for a large portion of \\naccidents caused by accidentally pressing the accelerator \\ninstead of the brake in parking lots and elsewhere.* This \\nhas attracted significant attention as a social issue.\\n\\u2003 Toward its ultimate goal of eliminating traffic accident \\ncausalities, Toyota has developed safety technologies \\ngrounded in the pursuit of real-world safety. New vehicle \\nmodels are now equipped with Toyota Safety Sense, \\nwhich is expected to help prevent and mitigate such \\naccidents as running into pedestrians and rear-end colli\\xad\\nsions, as well as Intelligent Clearance Sonar (ICS—park\\xad\\ning support braking that scans for stationary objects), \\nwhich is expected to prevent and mitigate the severity of \\nlow-speed collisions, such as those in parking lots.\\n\\u2003 Furthermore, in light of the growing issue of accidents \\ncaused by elderly drivers, in 2018, in addition to systems \\noffered in new cars, we introduced a pedal misapplication \\nprevention system that can be retrofitted in cars that cus\\xad\\ntomers already own. We plan to expand the number of \\nmodels for which retrofit systems are available to 12 by \\nthe end of 2019, focusing on common models that are \\npopular with elderly customers. \\n\\u2003 Along with initiatives to enhance the safety of cars \\nthemselves, we are implementing awareness-raising \\nactivities focused on people. A notable example is the \\napproximately 10,000 seminars we provide each year for \\ncustomers to help them  understand ICS systems.

At the same time, we are nurturing \\nskilled human resources able to advance the total \\noptimization of cars as well as development from the \\ncustomer’s perspective. At the Toyota ZEV Factory, \\nby consolidating all of Toyota’s functions related to \\nzero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), we will be able to \\nadvance the integrated planning, development, and \\nmanufacturing of next-generation ZEV products. The \\nexisting vehicle-based companies will also further \\nleverage the specific features of their respective cars, \\ncompeting with one another to further differentiate \\ntheir products from the customer’s perspective and \\nhone their efforts to make ever-better cars. \\n\\u2003 The second initiative is the evolution of the TNGA. \\nIn addition to global changes, such as the shift from \\nsedans to SUVs, region-specific customer preferenc\\xad\\nes are in constant flux. Rather than rigidly pushing \\ncomplete global standardization, we are making \\nadjustments by model and region to meet customer \\nneeds while advancing smart sharing and cost refine\\xad\\nment.

Reinforcing competitiveness, we \\nare pursuing development initiatives globally.\\n\\u2003 Initiatives under way include mobility services that \\nlook beyond the bounds of our conventional car sales \\nbusiness. Such services let more customers use \\nToyota vehicles while facilitating the efforts of diverse \\nstakeholders to foster a hydrogen-powered society.\\n\\u2003 In addition, we continue to reinforce our brand to \\nattract customers. These efforts comprise three pil\\xad\\nlars. The first is the “Start Your Impossible” global \\ncorporate campaign, launched in 2017. This cam\\xad\\npaign reflects Toyota’s aim of becoming a mobility \\ncompany providing mobility for all and aligns with \\nToyota’s spirit as a worldwide partner of the Olympic \\nand the Paralympic Games.\\n\\u2003 The second pillar is eco-cars, an area in which we \\nare leveraging our strengths. Focusing on eco-cars \\nand the Plant Zero CO2 Emission Challenge, we are \\ntransforming the way we make cars while working to \\nprotect our home planet—the Earth. The third pillar is \\nReinforcing Competitiveness and Being the “Best in Town” around the World \\nmotor sports through GAZOO Racing. Involvement in \\nmotor sports facilitates the further enhancement of \\never-better cars and helps foster a love of cars \\namong more people.\\n\\u2003 Customer tastes and technologies are evolving \\nfaster than ever. It is imperative that Toyota muster its \\nentrepreneurial spirit to enhance its competitiveness \\nworldwide. The foundation of such efforts will be the \\nToyota Way as applied to sales, namely, the “best in \\ntown” approach and Genchi Genbutsu (onsite, \\nhands-on experience).\\n\\u2003 Being the “best in town” means starting from the \\nassumption that markets are different in each country \\nand region and then listening, learning, and taking \\nappropriate action on the ground. Genchi Genbutsu \\nentails visiting target markets to gain a true under\\xad\\nstanding and taking action.\\n\\u2003 By promoting Toyota Way sales worldwide and \\nadvancing sales activities designed to secure constant \\nimprovement, I am confident that we can become the \\ntop mobility company in the hearts of customers.\\nTransformation Begins in Japan: \\nConfronting Global Challenges Head On\\nAs Toyota works to transform into a mobility compa\\xad\\nny, it is rolling out new initiatives first in Japan.\\n\\u2003 Based on the J-ReBORN Plan, launched in 2016, \\nToyota and its domestic sales companies aim to revital\\xad\\nize Japan as a whole as well as on a regional basis. To \\nthis end, Toyota is shifting its focus from sales channels \\nto sales regions. We are looking to revise our structure \\nand work styles accordingly. By doing so, we aim to \\nmeet the needs of customers in each region and rein\\xad\\nforce cooperation with the government and with other \\ncompanies. Ultimately we will transform our business \\nmodel by providing new mobility services. \\n\\u2003 These efforts kicked off in Tokyo, where changes in \\nmobility services are already the most advanced. In \\nApril 2019, we merged four directly managed dealers in \\nthe region to establish Toyota Mobility Tokyo.\\n\\u2003 Under the new company, the Tokyo region has \\ntaken the lead in commencing sales of all models at all \\nsales outlets. Originally, we were aiming for a gradual \\ntransition to the new approach at all of our 6,000 \\nnationwide sales outlets over the 2022–2025 period, \\nbut we now expect to complete the shift by May 2020.\\n\\u2003 In terms of new mobility services, we have suc\\xad\\ncessfully trialed KINTO, a monthly set-price subscrip\\xad\\ntion service for individual customers, in Tokyo and are \\nnow rolling it out across Japan.\\n\\u2003 Our business is based on the personal relation\\xad\\nships of trust with customers built by our nationwide \\nnetwork of 6,000 sales outlets and 110,000 employ\\xad\\nees. We will work on reinforcing existing businesses. \\nAt the same time we will expand lifestyle service busi\\xad\\nnesses. These businesses help our customers and \\nregions solve day-to-day issues.\\n\\u2003 For example, fuel cell vehicles, plug in hybrid elec\\xad\\ntric vehicles, and hybrid vehicles could be used to \\naugment the power supply in areas without power \\ndue to typhoons, flooding, or other natural disasters. \\nWe are also working on raising awareness so that \\ncustomers are able to put such vehicles to use in \\ntimes of emergency. \\n\\u2003 In the existing automotive business, we have \\nalready streamlined logistics by integrating genuine \\nToyota parts distributors with auto supply companies. \\nTo strengthen our customers’ car sales business, we \\nhave implemented comprehensive sales initiatives \\nencompassing the entire value chain, including sales, \\nmaintenance, and the handling of used vehicles. \\nGoing forward, focusing on vehicle usage, we will \\nadvance the development of services for corporate \\ncustomers, the KINTO beloved car subscription ser\\xad\\nvice, and car sharing for individuals to build a plat\\xad\\nform that will meet customer needs. Evolving quickly \\nand reinforcing our earnings structure, we will invest \\nin lifestyle service businesses and advance activities \\naimed at being the “best in town.”\\n\\u2003 Our business expansion plans begin with develop\\xad\\ning mobility-related services. By taking on the mobility \\nissues faced by customers in regions across Japan, \\nwe believe we can develop lifestyle service business\\xad\\nes. These include store-based services that continue \\nto serve customers long after they give up their driv\\xad\\ner’s licenses due to age.\\n\\u2003 By providing personal, heartfelt services that address \\nissues faced by its long-time customers, Toyota aims to \\nbe their lifelong close and trusted partner.\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\nEnhancing competitiveness and aiming for the top spot in \\nthe hearts of our customers with an entrepreneurial spirit.\\nDidier Leroy\\nExecutive Vice President,\\nMember of the Board of Directors\\nSupplying power\\nBusiness Transformation in Japan\\nInvest in the future and\\n expand our businesses\\nMobility\\nLifestyle support\\nOwnership: \\nUse: Corporations, rental cars, KINTO, sharing\\nChildren and young adults\\nFamilies\\nSeniors\\nElderly\\nReinforcing bonds \\nwith customers\\nNew car\\nServices\\nU-Car\\n9\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nGenchi Genbutsu: Improvement in Close Cooperation with Dealers\\nThe World’s First Fuel Cell Vehicle Taxi Service\\nIn France, which is working to build hydrogen power \\ninfrastructure, Toyota Motor Europe has formed the \\njoint venture HysetCo with the major gas company Air \\nLiquide and other partners. HysetCo is developing \\nHYPE, the world’s first fuel cell vehicle (FCEV) taxi ser\\xad\\nvice. Beginning with 25 Mirai FCEVs delivered in July \\n2017, HysetCo has gradually increased the HYPE fleet \\nand plans to have more than 200 vehicles providing \\nservices by the end of 2019. They will have 600 FCEV \\ntaxis on the streets of Paris by the end of 2020. Air \\nLiquide is supporting the project by building hydrogen \\nstations. Spurred by the establishment of the joint \\nventure, the company plans to build enough stations \\nto meet the needs of 600 Mirai FCEVs.\\n\\u2003 This project will supply environmentally sustainable \\nmobility using Toyota’s Fuel cell technology and pro\\xad\\nvide Toyota with experience in developing mobility ser\\xad\\nvices. The Mirai taxis, featuring a blue sky patterned \\nexterior, will help achieve Paris’s goals of zero emis\\xad\\nsions from taxis by 2024 while improving air quality.\\nThailand is home to one of Toyota’s longest-standing \\ncustomer bases; the Company’s first sales location \\nthere opened in 1957. However, in recent years, \\nToyota had struggled in the pickup segment. In light of \\nthis, we decided to go back to the basics, thinking \\nfrom the customer’s perspective and launching initia\\xad\\ntives in close cooperation with dealers. As part of \\nthese initiatives, the core management of Toyota \\nMotor Thailand began by visiting all 155 dealers \\nacross the country. Based on what they learned from \\ndealers, they quickly made decisions and took action \\nto address front-line issues. \\n\\u2003 Furthermore, we identified specific requests from \\neach region, studied past initiatives carried out by com\\xad\\npetitors, and implemented a range of improvements.\\n\\u2003 One initiative was to have dealers and events dis\\xad\\nplay the type of modified trucks used in grass-roots \\nracing popular with young people. Mod shops had \\nbeen reluctant to work on Toyota trucks, seeing them \\nas difficult to modify. However, through steadfast \\nnegotiation, we were able to make the display a reality. \\n\\u2003 We also coordinated with rear body production com\\xad\\npanies to offer one-stop financing options at sales outlets \\nfor both the trucks themselves and the rear body struc\\xad\\ntures, making the purchasing process easier. These new \\noptions have been well received by customers.\\n\\u2003 In addition to horizontally expanding successful ini\\xad\\ntiatives, we are providing insurance plans with flexible \\nrates for vehicles equipped with connected devices. \\nThese rates are adjusted depending on vehicle usage. \\n\\u2003 Through such initiatives to apply Genchi Genbutsu \\nand increase satisfaction, we increased our customer \\nappeal and reclaimed the market share we had lost. \\nFuel Cells: An Efficient Solution to Air Pollution from Commercial Heavy-duty Trucks \\nIn the United States, most road freight is transported \\nby large diesel trucks, which emit nitrogen oxide, par\\xad\\nticulate matter, and other air pollutants. As a result, \\ncommunities in areas near freeways, container ports, \\nwarehouse districts and other places with heavy truck \\ntraffic face serious air quality issues. The ports of Long \\nBeach and Los Angeles, in California, boast the high\\xad\\nest volume of container handling in the country. More \\nthan 17,000 such freight trucks, each with a large \\nenvironmental footprint, operate at these ports, and \\nthat figure is projected to rise to 32,000 by 2030. \\n\\u2003 In light of these circumstances, Toyota is working \\nwith a wide range of partners to contribute to commu\\xad\\nnities by utilizing fuel cell technologies, which emit no \\nCO2 or other air pollutants. \\n\\u2003 At the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach, \\nToyota has been conducting a pilot test of commercial \\nheavy-duty trucks equipped with fuel cell systems \\nsince 2017, continually making improvements. For \\nexample, in 2018, we upgraded some of the trucks \\nused in the project based on know-how gleaned from \\nthe approximately 16,000 km driven so far. \\n\\u2003 Since autumn 2018, Toyota has been participating \\nalongside U.S. truck manufacturer Kenworth and ener\\xad\\ngy company Shell in a new “Shore to Store” project \\nbeing implemented by the Port of Los Angeles aimed \\nat achieving zero-emission freight transport. This initia\\xad\\ntive seeks to first reduce emissions in heavily impacted \\nareas by introducing new cargo trucks mainly in the \\nport areas. Later on, we aim to expand beyond port \\nareas to build emissions-free logistics operations cov\\xad\\nering a broader area. These initiatives are expected to \\ncut annual greenhouse gas emissions by 465 tons \\nand annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, particulate \\nmatter, and other air pollutants by 0.72 tons. Under \\nthe project, the fuel cell system of Toyota’s Mirai is \\nbeing adapted for use with Kenworth T680 trucks to \\nachieve an estimated range of more than 300 miles \\n(approximately 480 km), twice the average daily driving \\ndistance of such trucks. We plan to deploy 10 of these \\ntrucks to haul freight from the Port of Los Angeles, with \\nthe first going into operation by the end of 2019.\\n\\u2003 By adapting its fuel cell technologies to freight \\ntrucks, which require a significant amount of hydrogen \\nfor their daily operation, Toyota is helping to spread \\nthe use of eco-vehicles while contributing to local \\ncommunities, creating solutions from the perspective \\nof protecting the Earth, our home planet.\\nArea covered by demonstration phase of the “Shore to Store” project\\nSource: CalEPA\\nReinforcing Competitiveness and Being the “Best in Town” around the World \\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\n60 miles\\nRegional Delivery\\n(POLA ⇔ Inland)\\nRegional Delivery\\n(POLA ⇔ Inland)\\nPOLA\\n(Port of Los Angeles)\\nLocal Delivery\\n(within Inland)\\nM Disadvantaged Community (by CalEPA)\\n10\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nTaking Ever-better Cars Further through Motor Sports : GAZOO Racing\\nThe Flagship Sports Car of \\nthe Toyota Brand\\nAt the 2019 North American International Auto \\nShow, Toyota premiered its GR Supra, which \\nPresident Akio Toyoda described as an “old friend” \\nback from a 17-year hiatus. Toyoda, who had \\nbecome the pupil of the late master driver Hiromu \\nNaruse in 2002, brought a used Supra to \\nNürburgring in Germany in 2006. The frustration \\nof\\xa0watching competitors test their prototypes there \\nin the years that Supra production was stopped \\nbecame yet another force driving the creation of \\never-better cars. \\n\\u2003 The GR Supra is the first global model of TOYOTA \\nGAZOO Racing’s GR sports car series. As the fifth \\ngeneration of the Supra, first introduced in 1978, the \\nGR Supra, like each generation before it, features an \\ninline six-cylinder engine and front-engine, rear-\\nwheel-drive powertrain. This time around, extensive \\nattention has also been paid to the three fundamen\\xad\\ntal elements of wheelbase, tread, and center of gravi\\xad\\nty to achieve handling performance befitting a pure \\nsports car. TOYOTA GAZOO Racing’s accumulated \\nexpertise and know-how have been funneled into the \\nnew GR Supra to create a car that people the world \\nover will find truly fun to drive and that will provide an \\nexperience that transcends the enjoyment of driving.\\n\\u2003 In 2018, Toyota’s hard work in the realm of motor \\nsports paid off, securing a long-coveted first victory \\nat Le Mans and a WRC manufacturer’s title. With the \\nGR Supra as it flagship model, Toyota will leverage \\nthe know-how developed in its motor sports activi\\xad\\nties around the world in the further expansion of the \\nGR series and product development more broadly.\\nDeveloping Our Cars and \\nOur People through Motor Sports \\nThe major motor sports competitions Toyota partici\\xad\\npates in include the FIA World Rally Championship \\n(WRC) and the FIA World Endurance Championship \\n(WEC), including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Standing \\nin contrast to these is the 24 Hours of Nürburgring \\nendurance race (NBR). Unlike the factory-backed \\nprofessional teams that compete in the WRC and \\nWEC, Toyota’s NBR team, including the mechanics \\nand engineers, comprises only Toyota employees, \\nwho compete with a race car built by employees \\nwho work on Toyota’s mass-production vehicles. \\nGAZOO Racing was established to compete in NBR \\nin 2007 with a team led by Hiromu Naruse. Since \\nthen, Toyota has taken employees to Nürburgring \\nevery year for the purpose of developing its cars and \\npeople to help make ever-better cars through the \\nextremities of this 24-hour race on what is reputed \\nto be one of the most challenging courses in the \\nworld. The experiences employees forge in these \\nharsh conditions are utilized in vehicle development. \\nAt the same time, parts and technologies that \\nToyota aims to commercialize are refined by use in \\nthe race vehicles employees build.\\n\\u2003 In 2019, its 13th year in the competition, Toyota \\nraced two vehicles. The first, as in 2018, was a \\nLEXUS LC equipped with a range of next-generation \\ntechnologies. The second, competing for the first \\ntime, was a GR Supra. Behind the wheel of the GR \\nSupra, President Toyoda took part as a driver for the \\nfirst time in three years. The GR Supra drove the full \\n24 hours with virtually no issues, finishing 41st over\\xad\\nall, while the LC finished 54th. \\nNew Technical Center:\\nPushing Automotive Manufacturing \\nFurther through Genchi Genbutsu\\nLaid out to resemble ordinary European country \\nroads, the Nürburgring is known as one of the \\nworld’s most difficult courses, with an exceptionally \\nlong circuit of 25 km, narrow track widths, a maxi\\xad\\nmum altitude difference of around 300 m, and more \\nthan 170 corners.\\n\\u2003 To further raise the bar in terms of driving perfor\\xad\\nmance, environmental friendliness, and safety as it \\nlooks to build the cars of the future and provide \\never-better cars to customers around the world, \\nToyota is constructing Toyota Technical Center \\nShimoyama in a mountainous area straddling the cit\\xad\\nies of Toyota and Okazaki. The full-scale opening of \\nthe facility is scheduled for fiscal 2023. Part of the \\nfacility, the 5.3 km country road test course, opened in \\nApril 2019. With a design based on our extensive \\nexperience at Nürburgring, the course takes advan\\xad\\ntage of the natural terrain, offering a maximum altitude \\ndifference of approximately 75 m and numerous \\n\\xad\\ncorners. Leveraging the challenging driving conditions \\nrecreated here, Toyota will thoroughly hone every one \\nof its models and strive to develop cars that epitomize \\nthe true joy of driving. At this time of transformation in \\nthe very nature of mobility, Toyota will remain true to its \\nstrengths of building cars through Genchi Genbutsu \\n(onsite, hands-on experience) and delivering emotional \\nperformances to bring smiles to customers’ faces.\\nIn addition, around 70% of the trees and greenery \\ncovering the site (approximately 650 hectares) have \\nbeen left undisturbed.

As part of the \\nToyota Environmental Challenge 2050, launched in \\n2015, we set for ourselves the New Vehicle Zero CO2 \\nEmissions Challenge, under which we aim to reduce \\nby 90% Toyota’s global average new vehicle CO2 \\nemissions during operation by 2050, compared with \\nthe 2010 level. Since launching the Prius hybrid elec\\xad\\ntric vehicle (HEV) in 1997, Toyota has sold approxi\\xad\\nmately 14 million electrified vehicles around the world \\n(as of July 2019), helping to cut CO2 emissions by \\nmore than an estimated 113 million tons. \\n\\u2003 In 2017, Toyota announced milestones for 2030 in \\nthe Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 that target \\nnew vehicle sales totaling 5.5 million electrified vehi\\xad\\ncles, including at least 4.5 million HEVs and plug-in \\nhybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and more than 1 million bat\\xad\\ntery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles \\n(FCEVs). Sales of electrified vehicles have recently \\nbeen growing at a pace that exceeds these targets. \\n\\u2003 Over the past few years, the frequency and extent \\nof damage caused by abnormal weather, such as tor\\xad\\nrential rainfall, and natural catastrophes has grown \\nworldwide. We can wait no longer to find solutions to \\nthe problem of global warming. Our problems will \\nmultiply unless we come up with fixes for air pollution \\nand energy issues. Addressing these global problems \\nwill require taking on fresh perspectives and looking \\nthrough the lenses of our hometowns, home coun\\xad\\ntries, and home planet. We must pass along to future \\ngenerations a deep sense of responsibility to care for \\nthese homes, instilling a love for the towns and coun\\xad\\ntries in which we were born and raised as well as a \\nlove for the planet that is the home of everyone in the \\nworld. Toyota is working on these environmental issues \\nwith the mindset that planet Earth is our only home. \\nRegulations Are Being Tightened, \\nalong with New Government Policies, \\nto Combat Global Warming. \\nTwo major trends in automobile-related environmental \\nregulations have drawn considerable attention lately. \\n\\u2003 The first is regulations on CO2 emissions and fuel \\nefficiency. Corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) is \\nthe average fuel efficiency of the entire fleet of auto\\xad\\nmobiles sold by an automaker, and governments \\nhave moved to regulate the automobile industry using \\nthis metric. Under this framework, which is increas\\xad\\ningly being adopted by countries worldwide, the \\nrequired level of cuts in CO2 emissions rises each \\nyear. In order to improve corporate average CO2 \\nemissions and fuel efficiency, companies must not \\nonly pursue technological innovation, but also transi\\xad\\ntion their mix of vehicle types toward models with \\nbetter fuel efficiency. With regard to CO2 regulations \\nin Europe, for example, Toyota led the industry in \\nmeeting 2017 regulatory values, and, although the \\ncurrent-generation Prius satisfies 2025 regulatory \\n\\xad\\nvalues, it is challenging for SUVs and other types of \\nrelatively heavy vehicles, even hybrid models, to clear \\nthis regulatory hurdle, necessitating the greater prolif\\xad\\neration of PHEVs, BEVs, and FCEVs. \\n\\u2003 The second trend entails regulations for zero emis\\xad\\nsion vehicles (ZEVs), which have come into effect in \\nsome parts of the United States and Canada, and \\nregulations for new energy vehicles (NEVs) in China. \\nAutomakers above a set production threshold are \\nobligated to ensure that vehicles like BEVs and \\nFCEVs account for a minimum percentage of sales. \\nThis government policy basically aims to increase the \\nnumber of vehicles on the road with zero CO2 emis\\xad\\nsions. Around the world, countries are projected to \\nincreasingly adopt similar regulations. Other govern\\xad\\nment incentives include subsidies, car access restric\\xad\\ntions, and priority car lane access. \\n\\u2003 To reduce CO2 emissions on a global scale, the fuel \\neconomy of entire fleets must be improved by round\\xad\\ning out the lineup of HEVs and PHEVs, while also \\nquickly getting customers to favor ZEVs over conven\\xad\\ntional vehicles, even in the absence of government \\nregulations and incentives. With a strong vision, \\nToyota is advancing various measures to increase the \\npopularity of electrified vehicles.\\nProviding More Electrification Technologies \\nand Systems to Reduce CO2 Emissions\\nSince introducing the first-generation Prius in 1997, \\nToyota has established mass production technologies \\nwhile honing the core technologies essential for elec\\xad\\ntrified vehicles for more than two decades. We have \\nput into place a global structure for producing 1.6 mil\\xad\\nlion electrified vehicles annually. Our motors, batteries, \\nand power control units (PCUs) are core technologies \\nthat are used in all kinds of electrified vehicles, includ\\xad\\ning HEVs, PHEVs, BEVs, and FCEVs. The foundation \\nthat we have built to date is one of our main strengths, \\nand where we can make a major contribution to the \\nspread of electrified vehicles in the future. \\n\\u2003 Over the past few years, Toyota has seen an \\nincrease in inquiries about its vehicle electrification \\nsystems from companies engaged in the develop\\xad\\nment of HEVs and other electrified vehicles.

In 2015, Toyota began offering royalty-free \\nlicenses to its proprietary fuel cell-related patents. \\n\\u2003 More recently, Toyota has decided to provide royal\\xad\\nty-free licenses to its portfolio of patents (about \\n23,740 patents) related to vehicle electrification tech\\xad\\nnologies, such as motors, PCUs, and system con\\xad\\ntrol—a legacy accumulated over more than 20 years \\nof HEV development. Additionally, Toyota will provide \\ntechnical support for the commercialization of electri\\xad\\nfied vehicles being developed and produced with its \\npowertrain system. \\n\\u2003 If these initiatives accelerate the development of \\nelectrified vehicles at other companies, we will have \\nhelped hasten the reduction of CO2 emissions. With \\nthe support of our many stakeholders, we aim to \\ncontribute to the popularity of electrified vehicles \\naround the world. \\nToyota is Full Steam Ahead on Initiatives to \\nPromote BEVs\\nThe Toyota ZEV Factory is an internal organization \\ncreated by bringing together the EV Business \\nPlanning Department, which began as an internal \\nstart-up, and the previously separate FCEV team. \\nThe Factory is charged with the planning and devel\\xad\\nopment of developing plans for BEVs. \\n\\u2003 Among electrified vehicles, Toyota is taking a broad \\napproach to developing BEVs ranging from pedestri\\xad\\nan-zone vehicles and ultra-compact two-passenger \\nvehicles to compact and mid-size passenger cars. In \\nDecember 2017, Toyota set itself the objective of \\nmaking a full-scale entry into the BEV market, begin\\xad\\nning in China, in 2020 before increasing its BEV mod\\xad\\nels worldwide to at least 10 models in the early \\n2020s. Toyota has advanced preparations in line with \\nthis schedule, unveiling the C-HR/IZOA model at the \\nShanghai Motor Show in April 2019. \\n\\u2003 With a mind to further promote BEVs, Toyota has \\nlaunched initiatives with the aim of building a new \\nbusiness model that, in the spirit of collaboration, \\nopenly includes business partners. This new business \\nconcept goes beyond the conventional model of \\ndeveloping and manufacturing BEVs for dealers who \\nthen distribute them to customers. To help make \\nsociety better, we will create a new business model \\nthat is open to partners who share our aspirations.\\n\\u2003 While improving product appeal by offering \\nhigh-endurance, high-performance batteries, Toyota \\nis maximizing the use of both BEVs and batteries \\nfrom production until final disposal to tackle issues \\nhindering the proliferation of BEVs. In addition to \\nsales, Toyota is expanding leasing, ensuring the col\\xad\\nlection of used vehicles, assessing used batteries, \\nand putting used vehicles back on the market while \\ngetting the maximum use out of batteries through \\nreuse as supply parts and in non-vehicle applications. \\nFurthermore, we offer peripheral services optimized \\nfor BEV owners, such as charging and insurance, so \\nthey can drive their BEVs without worrying about \\nthese details. We are keen to create new business \\nmodels like this with our business partners in other \\nfields as well. \\nJapan: Start Building a New Business Model for \\nUltra-Compact BEVs\\nIn Japan, Toyota sees new business opportunities \\nin\\xa0compact, short-distance, and corporate-use \\nBEVs.\\xa0For starters, in 2020 we plan to unveil an \\nultra-compact two-passenger BEV smaller than \\na\\xa0conventional light vehicle (which is already smaller \\nthan a standard passenger vehicle) and capable of \\ntraveling about 100 km on a single charge. This car \\nwill make it easy for young people who have just got \\ntheir driver’s license and elderly people to get around \\non a\\xa0daily basis. Our even-smaller i-ROAD three-\\nwheel BEV is undergoing pilot testing on public roads \\nfor possible use in car sharing services in urban areas \\nand tourist destinations. \\n\\u2003 Our pedestrian-zone BEVs, for use in areas where \\npeople walk, are being prepared for a 2020 launch. In \\naddition to a ride-while-standing model, we plan to \\nrelease a ride-while-sitting model and a wheel\\xad\\nchair-linked model in 2021. \\n\\u2003 By offering a diverse lineup of such BEVs, we will \\nprovide a means for safe, worry-free transportation in \\ntune with the life stage of each customer. In order to \\nsee such BEVs gain popularity, we are engaged in \\ntalks with business partners in various fields and local \\ngovernments interested in using BEVs, with the inten\\xad\\ntion of creating integrated business models covering \\ndevelopment and sale through final disposal. \\nTogether with diverse like-minded stakeholders, we \\nare taking steps to support lifestyles in tune with the \\nneeds of communities and our customers. \\nDevelopment of BEVs for China, the United States, \\nand Europe\\nFor markets with strong demand for BEVs, Toyota is \\nefficiently developing reasonably priced models in \\na\\xa0sufficient variety to meet diverse customer needs. \\nConcretely, we are developing specific types of \\n\\xad\\nvehicles to meet specific customer needs. We are \\nplanning and developing these various models in \\n\\xad\\ncollaboration with partner firms, such as Subaru \\nCorporation, Suzuki Motor Corporation, and Daihatsu \\nMotor Co., Ltd., to leverage to their respective areas \\nof expertise. Toyota has signed an agreement to \\njointly develop BEVs with BYD Co., Ltd., and the two \\nparties are developing BEVs and batteries with the \\naim of bringing to the Chinese market a BEV under \\nthe Toyota brand in the first half of the 2020s. \\nDevelopment and Supply of World-Leading \\nBatteries\\nBatteries are a core technology used in all electrified \\nvehicles and have a significant impact on vehicle per\\xad\\nformance. Toyota has finely honed this core technology \\nover the course of developing and marketing more \\nthan 14 million HEVs. For example, Toyota’s HEVs are \\nhighly efficient systems that, even with only a small \\nbattery capacity, achieve low fuel consumption. In \\nterms of durability, a factor that has an outsized \\nimpact on BEV performance, and residual capacity \\nafter a long period of use, Toyota batteries have \\ndemonstrated industry-leading performance with \\nregard to units used in its first-generation Prius PHV, \\nwhich was launched in 2012, as well as its second-\\ngeneration Prius that was unveiled in 2017.

Toyota contin\\xad\\nues to carry on battery development with an eye on \\nachieving world-leading performance when it brings \\nBEV models to market globally. \\n\\u2003 The promise of electrified vehicles has exceeded \\nour initial expectations, and we must now prepare for \\nthe full-fledged proliferation of BEVs that will require \\nhigher-capacity batteries than those used in HEVs \\nand PHEVs. To cooperate on battery procurement, \\nToyota jointly established Primearth EV Energy Co., \\nLtd. with Panasonic Corporation in 1996, and we \\nhave signed an agreement to create a new joint \\n\\xad\\nventure by the end of 2020. \\n\\u2003 To rapidly meet the diverse needs of regions \\naround the world, Toyota has put into place a struc\\xad\\nture for procuring the batteries needed to make elec\\xad\\ntrified vehicles more popular, while coordinating and \\ncollaborating with Contemporary Amperex \\nTechnology Co., Ltd. (CATL), BYD Co., Ltd., GS \\nYuasa Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Toyota \\nIndustries Corporation. \\n\\u2003 In preparing for the spread of BEVs and to win over \\ncustomers to our BEVs, we have a long list of initia\\xad\\ntives to follow through on, including developing vehi\\xad\\ncles, ensuring the stable supply of batteries, improving \\nthe durability of batteries, and preparing for the reuse \\nof older batteries. Toyota has been making steady \\nprogress on building business structures, including \\nthe creation of new business models. With an eye on \\nhelping to create a better society, we are open to \\nworking with a wider range of business partners than \\never before, and intend to accelerate our efforts with \\npartners who share our vision for the future. \\nAiming to Expand Ultimate Eco-Car FCEVs\\nToyota views hydrogen as a promising energy for the \\nfuture, and came up with the concept of the Ultimate \\nEco-Car as an FCEV that will be key in a sustainable \\nsociety. With the aim of encouraging the spread of \\nFCEVs and realizing a hydrogen-powered society, \\nToyota intends to spur demand for hydrogen by \\nleveraging the synergistic effects of introducing FCEV \\npassenger cars and commercial vehicles. For start\\xad\\ners, we are developing an FCEV version of mass-\\nproduction passenger cars while continuing to \\nimprove performance and bring costs down. We will \\nthen apply these FCEV technologies to commercial \\nvehicles, which are fewer in number but use larger \\namounts of energy per vehicle. As demand for hydro\\xad\\ngen expands, the price of hydrogen should decrease \\nand create incentives to expand related infrastructure. \\n\\u2003 In the passenger car market, Toyota has taken the \\ninitiative in encouraging the spread of FCEVs with the \\n2014 launch of the Mirai, which has sold approximately \\n10,000 units in total around the world. In late 2020, \\nToyota plans to release the next-generation Mirai with \\na 30% longer cruising range than the previous gener\\xad\\nation, thanks to a completely revamped fuel cell (FC) \\nsystem, drastic improvements in performance for a \\nFCEV, and a larger hydrogen tank. We will greatly \\nincrease our production capacity for FCEVs along with \\nthe launch of this next-generation Mirai. \\n\\u2003 Turning to commercial vehicles, Toyota plans to \\nintroduce 10 FC commercial heavy-duty trucks for \\na\\xa0project being promoted by the Port of Los Angeles \\nthat aims to achieve zero emissions in cargo trans\\xad\\nportation with the use of FC technology. Toyota plans \\nto construct a Tri-Gen* facility to generate electricity \\nusing carbonate fuel cell power generation tech\\xad\\nniques that extract hydrogen from waste biomass. \\nThis facility will be used to refuel these 10 FC com\\xad\\nmercial heavy-duty trucks. Plans also call for using \\nthe hydrogen fuel in non-transportation applications. \\n\\u2003 In 2020, the Olympic and Paralympic Games will \\nbe held in Tokyo. As a Worldwide Partner, Toyota \\nplans to give the world a glimpse into the hydrogen-\\npowered society of the future with around 500 \\nFCEVs, the SORA FC bus, and FC forklifts. \\n* \\x07\\nTri-Gen is short for Tri-Generation, the production of water, electricity, \\nand hydrogen. \\nSpeeding the Popularization of Electrified Vehicles for Our Home Planet\\nParticipation in an International Space \\nExploration Mission \\nAiming for world-class durability \\nby\\xa0limiting battery degradation \\nthrough innovations in battery \\nmaterials, pack structure, and \\n\\xad\\ncontrol systems\\nIn addition to long-standing \\n\\xad\\npartners Panasonic Corporation \\nand Primearth EV Energy Co., Ltd., \\n\\xad\\ncollaborate with global battery \\nmakers to respond to the rapid \\npopularization of electrified vehicles\\nToyota and the Japan Aerospace Exploration \\nAgency (JAXA) have been working together on the \\ndevelopment of a manned, pressurized rover that \\nuses FCEV technology for an international effort to \\nexplore the moon’s surface, providing the mobility \\nsolution required for the human exploration of the \\nmoon.

TRI develops \\nproof of concept vehicles that incorporate new capa\\xad\\nbilities; TRI-AD builds on these, incorporating TRI’s \\nautomated driving research and working to mature \\nboth the software and hardware to create viable \\npre-production vehicles. Innovation will continue even \\nafter vehicles are sold using Over-The-Air (OTA) \\nupdates for continuous performance improvements \\nand added functionality. In this way, TRI-AD is the \\nbridge to the creation of world-leading software for auto\\xad\\nmated vehicles that achieves production level quality.\\n\\u2003 Toyota and TRI-AD are working toward mass pro\\xad\\nduction in partnership with the integrated vehicle \\ncontrol systems company J-QuAD DYNAMICS \\n(established as a joint venture of DENSO, Aisin Seiki, \\nADVICS, and JTEKT).

Additionally, Toyota must make \\nbreakthroughs in performance of these systems ver\\xad\\nsus hardware cost, so as to deploy the system in a \\nlarger number of vehicles.\\n\\u2003 Guardian can also be combined in parallel with the \\nL4 and L5 automated driving systems developed by \\nToyota or other companies to enhance safety and \\nquality. In other words, Guardian can serve as a \\ncheck for Chauffeur-type systems, from another point \\nof view, to provide redundancy and lower the chance \\nof system failure.\\nAdvances in Active Safety and Automated \\nDriving Research and Development \\nBlended Envelope Control\\nOne area of recent progress by the TRI is a Guardian \\ncapability called “blended envelope control.” Blended \\nenvelope control is inspired and informed by the way \\nthat modern fighter jets operate. A pilot controls the \\nstick, but actually does not fly the plane directly. \\nInstead, the pilot’s intent is translated by the flight \\ncontrol system to stabilize the aircraft and stay within \\na specific safety envelope. Applying this same \\napproach to cars is much more challenging because \\nof traffic. In the case of a car, the safety envelope is \\ndefined not only by vehicle dynamics, but also by \\nperception and prediction of other agents, which \\nmakes the envelope computation variable and \\ndynamic. If a driver begins to reach the edge of \\na\\xa0dynamically changing safety envelope, the machine \\nbegins to collaborate with the driver, first warning, \\nthen nudging the vehicle back into a safe corridor. \\nThe control envelope is not a discrete on-off switch \\nbetween the human and the automated driving sys\\xad\\ntem. Rather, it is a seamless blend of both, working \\nas teammates, to extract the best input from each.\\nTRI-P4 Automated Driving Test Vehicle\\nIn January 2019, TRI unveiled the TRI-P4, its \\nnext-generation automated driving test vehicle. \\nBased on the fifth-generation Lexus LS 500h, the \\nnew vehicle helps accelerate the development of \\nautomated driving technology for both the Chauffeur \\nand Guardian approaches. The TRI-P4 is Toyota’s \\nmost advanced automated driving research vehicle \\nwith greater perception and computing power, capa\\xad\\nble of operating a large number of machine learning \\nalgorithms in parallel for faster learning.\\nRADICAL Software\\nTRI has developed RADICAL, short for Robust \\nAutonomous Driving Incorporating Cameras And \\nLearning, an umbrella term that describes the vision \\nfor its approach to automated driving. This approach \\nis made possible by lower-cost cameras becoming \\nmore ubiquitous combined with dramatic advances in \\naccurate perception with advanced machine learning. \\nUsing RADICAL, TRI has also created a robust object \\nperception pipeline that can recognize objects, clas\\xad\\nsify road segments, and predict the future behavior of \\ndynamic agents in the world.\\n\\u2003 The RADICAL software architecture can take \\nadvantage of available high definition maps, but does \\nnot require them, allowing the system to work in \\nunmapped areas and to be used in more locations \\naround the world. Hand in hand with this approach, \\nTRI has also developed a state-of-the-art large-scale \\nSimultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) \\nframework for on-board dynamic map generation \\nand precision localization.\\n\\u2003 Furthermore, TRI has developed cloud-based \\n\\xad\\nsimulation technology in order to conduct large-scale \\ntesting and accurately measure the overall perfor\\xad\\nmance and capability of the system. \\nMichigan Closed-course Test Facility\\nDuring 2019, TRI completed the build out of its \\n\\xad\\ndedicated test track in Ottawa Lake, Michigan, \\n\\xad\\nallowing closed-course testing of RADICAL software \\nTRI-P4, Next-Generation Automated Driving \\nResearch Vehicle\\nImage of RADICAL Software Coverage\\nMichigan Closed-course Test Facility\\n16\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\n“In order to succeed in our mission to deliver \\nworld-leading technology, the most important ingre\\xad\\ndient is building a world-leading team of engineers \\nand professionals.

Insurance companies and companies \\nthat provide services such as ride-sharing and \\ncar-sharing can offer services linked to Toyota and \\nLexus vehicle information via the MSPF. Through \\nconnected technology, Toyota is transforming itself \\nfrom a car company into a mobility company—a pro\\xad\\nvider of the value of movement itself and peripheral \\nservices for society. In this way, we are aiming for \\nnew growth as a mobility service platform provider. \\nInitiatives in Connected Cars and MaaS in Toyota’s Transformation into a Mobility Company\\nToyota has set its sights on new growth as a mobility \\nservice platform provider through connected technology. \\nShigeki Tomoyama\\nExecutive Vice President\\nOur Connected Strategy has three faces: defense, \\nKaizen, and offense. Defense entails the establishment \\nof long-term relationships of trust with customers and \\nthe maintenance and expansion of existing value chains. \\nKaizen encompasses reforms to traditional ways of \\nworking and making major improvements in quality, \\nlead times, and productivity. Offense is about creating \\nnew value for cars and a new mobility business. \\n\\u2003 Key defensive initiatives for our Connected \\nStrategy include e-Care and health check services, \\nentailing timely after-sales services offered by dealers \\nand call centers based on vehicle data. In addition to \\ndelivering a worry-free car ownership experience, we \\nbelieve these initiatives will enhance customer loyalty \\nto Toyota and Lexus vehicles and increase the volume \\nof business for dealers that provide these services. \\n\\u2003 A key aspect of Kaizen is early detection and early \\nresolution (EDER) based on vehicle data. Drawing \\nfrom a constant stream of vehicle data, the EDER \\napproach enables Toyota to quickly detect market \\ndefects and facilitate rapid and efficient market \\n\\xad\\nremedies. Furthermore, over-the-air (OTA) software \\nupdates ensure a vehicle’s software is always the \\n\\xad\\nlatest version. \\n\\u2003 In terms of offense, we are keen to generate new \\nvalue for cars and create new mobility businesses. \\nFor example, Toyota’s agent function creates new \\nvalue. A cloud-based AI assistant, the agent serves \\nthe wishes of drivers by facilitating their interaction \\nwith their vehicles. Agent 1.0 functionality has \\nbecome a practical reality, allowing drivers to use \\nnatural speech when communicating with car naviga\\xad\\ntion systems. In the future, we plan to launch more \\nadvanced Agent 2.0 functionality. Creating new \\nmobility businesses, such as MaaS, is the area in \\nwhich we aim for new growth into a mobility company. \\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\nDCM*2\\nDCM\\nDCM\\nDCM\\nDCM\\nGlobal Communication Platforms\\nTimely maintenance/\\nafter-sales service\\nDealers/Call centers\\nBig data\\n(Toyota Big Data Center)\\nUse of Big Data \\n(EDER, quality management)\\nBasic telematics services\\n(e-Care, agent, etc.)\\nAuthentication\\nOTA update of \\non-board software\\nToyota Smart Center\\nFinance function \\nToyota Financial \\nServices Corporation\\nUtilizing trafﬁc \\ninformation/\\nvehicle data\\nFleet vehicle\\nmanagement\\nSmart Key Box/\\nTransLog\\nFlexible leasing\\nTelematics insurance\\nApplication Programming Interface (API*1)\\nMobility Service Platform\\nGovt. ofﬁces, \\nOlympic &\\nParalympic\\nAccommodation \\nand food \\nand drink\\nMobile retailers\\nLogistics\\nTaxi\\nRent-a-car\\nCar-sharing\\nRide-sharing\\nInsurance\\nService companies\\nAutomated \\ndriving system \\nprovisioning\\nDevelopment \\ncompanies\\nMSPF Information Infrastructure That Supports Our Connected Strategy\\n*1 \\x07\\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface, a set of subroutines used to program software.

In both approaches, \\nwe place emphasis on expanding the deployment of \\nToyota vehicles, as well as on securing value chains \\nin maintenance, insurance, and leasing. With an eye \\nto the future, Toyota has set its sights on becoming a \\nmobility service platform provider able to comprehen\\xad\\nsively furnish everything from vehicles to maintenance \\nservices when MaaS evolves to include ride-sharing \\nservices based on automated vehicles. \\nIncreasingly Popular Mobility Services \\naround the World\\nCollaboration with Leading MaaS Providers\\nPartnership with Grab: Provision of Total Care \\nServices\\nIn December 2018, Toyota and Toyota dealers began \\nproviding total care services for ride-sharing vehicles \\nin partnership with Grab Holdings, Inc., one of the \\nlargest ride-sharing companies in Southeast Asia. \\nThese services include insurance and maintenance \\nlinked to driving data from connected rental cars that \\nGrab rents out to its drivers. Toyota and Grab are \\nexpanding this service to all Grab vehicles in Southeast \\nAsia while at the same time increasing the ratio of \\nToyota vehicles used by Grab to 80% in the region. \\nPartnership with Uber: Development of Automated \\nDriving Technologies for Ride-Sharing Services\\nIn April 2019, Toyota, along with DENSO Corporation, \\nopened a collaboration center with Uber Technologies \\nInc.’s Advanced Technologies Group (Uber ATG) to \\nadvance the development and commercialization of \\ncars equipped with automated driving technologies for \\nride-sharing services. Under this partnership, the com\\xad\\npanies aim to develop and mass produce automated \\ndriving systems (ADSs) for vehicles while standardizing \\nthe vehicle interfaces required for automated driving, \\nwith the aim of bringing to market ride-sharing services \\nthat fully utilize automated driving technologies. \\nPartnership with DiDi: Establishment of \\n\\xad\\nRide-Sharing Vehicle Rental Business\\nToyota and Didi Chuxing Technology Co., one of the \\nlargest ride-sharing companies in China, established \\na joint venture in September 2019 to launch a car \\nrental operation for DiDi drivers. These rental cars will \\nreceive the same total care services for ride-sharing \\nvehicles that Toyota provides for Grab. The two com\\xad\\npanies are also looking into rolling out BEVs for MaaS \\nthat would dovetail with mobility services in China. \\nMONET’s Business Development: Solving \\nMobility Problems in Society\\nMONET Technologies Corporation was established \\nby Toyota and SoftBank Corporation in October 2018 \\nto focus on solving mobility problems in Japan, such \\nas traffic congestion in cities or elderly access to \\ntransportation in underpopulated areas. MONET \\nTechnologies has begun coordination with 25 local \\ngovernments across Japan to provide next-generation \\non-demand mobility services. In addition, we created \\nthe MONET consortium with 400 member compa\\xad\\nnies. Trials of on-demand bus services are already \\nunder way in the cities of Yokohama, Toyota, and \\nFukuyama as is an on-demand commuter shuttle in \\nthe Marunouchi district of Tokyo. \\nMaaS with Toyota and Toyota Dealers Taking \\nthe\\xa0Lead\\nToyota Share and Chokunori!\\nIn October 2019, Toyota dealers and Toyota car rent\\xad\\nal and leasing branches in Japan began to offer \\nToyota Share car-sharing services and Chokunori! \\nunmanned rent-a-car services. These services feature \\nSmart Key Box (SKB), which lets users unlock vehi\\xad\\ncles with their smartphones, and TransLog, a com\\xad\\nmunications-linked driving recorder. With only a \\nsmartphone, a customer can sign up, unlock a car, \\nreturn the car, and settle their account. \\n\\u2003 Servco Pacific Inc., a Toyota distributor in Hawaii, \\nrolled out its Hui unmanned car rental service in July \\n2018, becoming a model for developing MaaS for \\nToyota distributors in other countries. \\nInitiatives in Connected Cars and MaaS in Toyota’s Transformation into a Mobility Company\\nMONET: Pilot Testing\\nCoordination with local governments: \\nOn-demand bus services\\nCoordination with businesses: \\nOn-demand commuter shuttle\\nA vehicle in operation\\nExample interior of a vehicle for \\nbusiness professionals\\nGrab: Total Care Service\\n1\\n2\\nRide-sharing/\\nCar-sharing/\\nCar rental companies\\nToyota & Financing/\\nInsurance companies\\nToyota & Dealers\\nRide-sharing/\\nCar-sharing/ \\nCar rental \\nFinance\\nInsurance\\nMaintenance\\nSales\\nManufacturing\\nSecuring value chains in the MaaS domain\\nToyota- and\\nToyota dealer-led model \\nCollaboration\\nModel\\nTwo Approaches to MaaS Strategy\\nToyota dealers\\nUse for maintenance\\nTelematic drive recorder TransLog\\nDriving data /\\ndangerous behavior\\nVehicle data\\nUse for vehicle management/\\nto encourage safe driving\\nUse for scoring\\nRide-sharing company\\nProvision of \\ntelematics insurance\\nInsurance company\\n19\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nFuture Lineup of MaaS Vehicles\\nExisting passenger cars are currently being deployed \\nas vehicles for ride-sharing and car-sharing services \\nunder MaaS initiatives. In the future, we believe vehi\\xad\\ncles designed specifically for MaaS will become nec\\xad\\nessary, and Toyota plans to add three such models \\nto its lineup. \\n\\u2003 In addition to the e-Palette model unveiled at CES \\n2018, Toyota is working on a mid-size vehicle based \\non the Sienna and an even smaller BEV compact \\nmodel. Building on these MaaS vehicles, Toyota envi\\xad\\nsions mobility services using automated driving tech\\xad\\nnologies, a concept it has dubbed Autono-MaaS.\\nToward the Realization of Autono-MaaS\\nToyota is advancing the development of autonomous \\nvehicles for use in Autono-MaaS based on the idea \\nthat mass-produced vehicles capable of SAE \\nInternational level 2 or level 3 autonomy can be \\nequipped with ADSs to create MaaS vehicles with \\nlevel 4 autonomy. In some cases, a third-party devel\\xad\\noper will supply the automated driving software for \\nthe ADS, and the Toyota Guardian system installed in \\nthe base vehicles will provide a layer of redundancy \\nby monitoring surrounding conditions to increase \\noverall vehicle safety. Moreover, Toyota will standard\\xad\\nize the vehicle control interfaces (VCIs) that connect \\nADSs and vehicles and make control units, including \\nthe Toyota Guardian system, versatile enough to use \\nwith any vehicle or ADS. By doing so, we aim to pro\\xad\\nvide safe and reasonably priced Autono-MaaS. \\nGuardian System, p. 15\\nMore details\\nMaaS and TPS\\nVehicles for ride-sharing and car-sharing services are \\nused at far higher rates than privately owned and used \\nvehicles and thus require more frequent maintenance. \\nIn order to shorten vehicle down time and reduce the \\ncost of maintenance, Toyota is basing its maintenance \\napproach on the Toyota Production System (TPS). For \\nexample, for the total care services that we provide for \\nride-sharing vehicles used by Grab, Toyota dealers \\nhave been furnished with stalls for providing concen\\xad\\ntrated service called Intensive Care Stalls (ICSs) that \\nleverage TPS improvements to shorten maintenance \\ndown time and improve work quality. \\n\\u2003 Looking ahead, to realize MaaS, it will be vital not \\nonly to develop tailor-made vehicles and software, \\nbut to improve the productivity and quality of related \\noperations, such as maintenance and cleaning ser\\xad\\nvices. Introducing TPS is becoming a key factor in \\nmaking this a reality. \\nReal-World Technology and Assets as \\nOur Strengths\\nIT firms and companies in other sectors have made \\ninroads into the MaaS domain, but IT and AI alone \\nwill not lead to the creation of a safe and convenient \\nmobility society. Cars are already a combination of \\nadvanced hardware and software, a form of transpor\\xad\\ntation that entails a duty of responsibility for people’s \\nlives. To provide cars that are mass produced at \\nexcellent quality and cost and maintained at regular \\nintervals as a safe and reasonable means of transpor\\xad\\ntation, Toyota must leverage all its accumulated real-\\nworld know-how and technologies, starting with TPS, \\nand all its real-world assets, including its service net\\xad\\nwork. Along with the development of cutting-edge \\ntechnologies, Toyota will continue to refine quality and \\nimprove productivity in its traditional automobile busi\\xad\\nness. A key issue going forward will be integrating \\nthis business with the potential of new businesses. \\n\\u2003 Through connected technology and MaaS, Toyota \\naims to create a safe and comfortable mobility soci\\xad\\nety with freedom of movement for all. \\nInitiatives in Connected Cars and MaaS in Toyota’s Transformation into a Mobility Company\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\nAutomated Vehicles for Autono-MaaS\\nReal-World Expertise and Technology: ICS*\\nStandardized work with work-assistance carts\\nVoice input of maintenance records saves time\\n* ICS: Intensive Care Stall\\nMaaS-dedicated Vehicle Lineup\\ne-Palette\\nMaaS Sienna\\nMaaS BEV\\nApplication\\nMulti-purpose, \\nshort-range transportation \\n(people and goods)\\nMedium- and long-range \\nride-sharing services\\nShort- and medium-range \\nride-sharing services\\nLaunch\\nOlympic and Paralympic \\nGames Tokyo 2020\\n2021\\n—\\nMotor\\nBEV\\nHEV\\nBEV\\nSize\\nLarge\\nMedium\\nSmall\\nGeneralization\\nStandardization\\nHuman driver\\nSensor\\nBattery\\nMotor\\nBrakes\\nSteering\\nVehicle control computer (VCC)\\nGuardian System\\nVehicle control interface (VCI)\\nCommands\\nVehicle status\\nSensors \\nCameras \\nLiDER\\nSoftware \\nAI\\nAutonomous vehicle\\ncontrol computer\\nADS system makeup\\nSoftware updates\\nData collection\\nMobility Service \\nPlatform\\nADS*\\nSensor\\nSensor\\nCameras\\nSensor\\n* ADS: Automated Driving System\\n20\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nEnabling Active Participation in Society for All with Partner Robots \\nExpanding the Scope of Support Provided by \\nPartner Robots to Include All People\\nToyota’s founder, Kiichiro Toyoda, espoused the \\nview that “A machine is complete only when it \\nworks in perfect harmony with people.” In line with \\nthis sentiment, Toyota has always introduced \\nrobots not to replace people, but to collaborate \\nwith them. We believe that only when robots work \\nin harmony with people can they fulfill their true pur\\xad\\npose, and by working in harmony with robots, peo\\xad\\nple can expand and strengthen their abilities. This \\napproach is different from full automation, in which \\nrobots operate alone, and it is the reason that \\nToyota calls the robots it develops “partner robots.”\\nToyota’s Three Types of Movement\\nToyota seeks to provide freedom of movement for \\nall through partner robots and robotics technolo\\xad\\ngies. By “movement,” Toyota refers to not only the \\nphysical movement of a person or thing from one \\nlocation to another, but also virtual movement, \\nusing an avatar or agent to move a part or the \\nwhole of oneself remotely, as well as the feeling of \\nbeing moved emotionally by the excitement of \\nexperiencing new things and meeting and interact\\xad\\ning with others that other kinds of movement make \\npossible. Toyota aims to one day provide high-quality \\npartner robots at affordable prices to help enable \\nactive participation in society for all. \\n\\u2003 Through the development of robots and robotics \\ntechnologies, Toyota will continue to blaze the trail \\nforward to create ever-better communities in which \\nall people can participate with a sense of purpose. \\nHuman Support Robot:\\nHSR\\nToyota’s human support robot (HSR) can \\nmove independently or via manual control \\nand grasp and fetch objects. Because the \\nHSR can be controlled remotely, it offers \\nthe potential to perform work offsite. In \\n2015, to enhance the HSR’s functionality, \\nToyota created the HSR Development \\nCommunity. As of October 31, 2019, 50 \\ninstitutions in 14 countries are taking part in \\nthis community. Furthermore, the HSR has \\nbeen selected as a platform for the world\\xad\\nwide RoboCup competition and the World \\nRobot Summit, sponsored by the Ministry \\nof Economy, Trade and Industry. We have \\nalso begun joint development with \\nPreferred Networks using the HSR with the \\naim of creating robots capable learning in \\ntypical living environments to cater to future \\nmarket needs. At the Olympic and \\nParalympic Games Tokyo 2020 (the Tokyo \\n2020 Games), for a portion of the wheel\\xad\\nchair accessible seating at the Olympic \\nStadium, the HSR will guide guests to their \\nseats and offer assistance to help them to \\nmore freely enjoy the competition.\\nHumanoid Robot: \\nT-HR3\\nThe T-HR3 is a remotely controlled robot \\nthat allows the operator to feel external \\nforces applied to the T-HR3 while recreating \\nthe operator’s movements. Capable of gen\\xad\\ntle, smooth movement, the T-HR3 is \\ndesigned with the aim of serving as a part\\xad\\nner robot that can safely provide assistance \\nin daily life alongside humans in a variety of \\nsettings, such as the home or office. Going \\nforward, Toyota hopes to develop applica\\xad\\ntions for its use in such hazardous condi\\xad\\ntions as disaster-stricken areas and \\nconstruction sites. At the Tokyo 2020 \\nGames, Toyota will provide “mascot robots” \\nfeaturing a simplified, miniaturized version \\nof the T-HR3’s control system. Through \\ncommunication and remote control via the \\nmascot robot and T-HR3, guests in remote \\nlocations will be able to interact with ath\\xad\\nletes and truly feel the atmosphere of the \\nevent as if they were there in person.\\nRehabilitation Robot: \\nWelwalk\\nFrom autumn 2017, we began rental of the \\nWelwalk WW-1000, a robot designed to aid \\nin the gait training of patients with lower \\nlimb paralysis due to stroke or other fac\\xad\\ntors. Since then, we have delivered 80 units \\nto medical institutions across Japan. In \\nNovember 2019, we announced a succes\\xad\\nsor model, the Welwalk WW-2000, which \\ncan analyze patient’s gait characteristics to \\nsuggest appropriate parameter settings \\nand includes gaming functions to increase \\npatient motivation. In addition, we moved to \\nin-house production, leveraging the quality \\nmanagement functions of the Motomachi \\nPlant developed through car production, \\nand switched from rental to sales. \\n\\u2003 With an eye to overseas expansion, we \\nhave begun experimental research in partner\\xad\\nship with Chulalongkorn University in Thailand \\nand China Medical University in China. \\nAI Athlete Robot: \\nCUE\\nCUE began as a project of the Toyota \\nEngineering Society,* a voluntary employee \\norganization within Toyota. The team mem\\xad\\nbers had zero experience in developing \\nrobots and were also complete beginners \\nwhen it came to AI. They studied from \\nscratch and, through a process of trial and \\nerror, developed CUE, an AI basketball \\nrobot that scores 100% of its shots. Now \\nan official member of the team Alvark \\nTokyo, CUE has expanded the area from \\nwhich it can shoot with each season it has \\nplayed. Its rapid progress caught the atten\\xad\\ntion of Guinness World Records, and after \\na\\xa0six hour, thirty-five minute attempt, it offi\\xad\\ncially set a new record, “Most consecutive \\nbasketball free throws by a humanoid robot \\n(assisted),” with 2,020 shots. \\n* \\x07\\nToyota Engineering Society: A voluntary organiza\\xad\\ntion inaugurated in 1947 to contribute to the \\ndevelopment of technological fields in various \\nareas of business.

The situation at such sites is ever-changing. As \\nsuch, quick judgment and swift, on-the-spot decision \\nmaking, and sometimes even major manpower mobi\\xad\\nlization, is crucial to avoid keeping customers waiting. \\n\\u2003 At Toyota, when a problem occurs at a production \\nsite, the first thing we do is halt the operation in ques\\xad\\ntion. We seek to identify the precise issue and its root \\ncause, then implement steps to prevent recurrences \\nand improve. The experience built up in this way, \\nhandling issues in the course of daily operations, \\nenables our people to respond quickly. The mindset \\nof always looking for ways to improve processes and, \\nreduce costs while adapting to new changes every \\nday and considering quality, production volume, and \\nabove all, safety, is firmly established.\\n\\u2003 I am constantly reminding those around me that \\ntoday’s best is not always tomorrow’s best, and that \\nwe must evolve every day. I believe that this spirit of \\nKaizen (improvement) will enable us to flexibly \\nrespond to large-scale change going forward.\\nFurther Deepening Our Culture of \\nImprovement \\nFront-line production sites have the advantage of clear \\ngoals, set in such terms as productivity and cost, and \\nthe effects of improvements are readily apparent. In con\\xad\\ntrast, at administrative and technical workplaces, due in \\npart to fine segmentation and specialization, the end \\nresults of one’s work can be less obvious, and the cul\\xad\\nture of seeking improvement every day is not as strong. \\n\\u2003 In spreading this culture of constant improvement \\nthroughout the Company, it is crucial that employees \\nthemselves seek to make changes in their work and \\nbe alert to opportunities for improvement. To encour\\xad\\nage this, since spring 2019, we have been calling for \\noperational improvement suggestions from throughout \\nthe Company under our Creative Suggestion system.* \\n\\u2003 As a result, Company-wide participation in the \\nCreative Suggestion system has risen from 60% to \\n90%. However, participation remains low in certain \\ndepartments, and I think it is too early to say that our \\ncorporate culture has truly changed. \\n\\u2003 While global annual vehicle production has been \\nsteadily above 10,000,000 units in recent years, we \\nare now pressed to fund the development of forward-\\nlooking technologies. We are therefore advancing \\nwith the understanding that we must continue to \\n\\xad\\nvigorously seek cost reduction. \\n* \\x07\\nCreative Suggestion: A system launched in 1951 through which \\nemployees propose suggestions for improvement.\\nCreating a Whole That Is Greater than \\nthe Sum of Its Parts\\nIn anticipation of the CASE* era, Toyota is seeking to \\nincrease its competitiveness through alliances. The \\nkey factor in alliances is people. The mere alignment \\nof company with company does not make either \\nstronger—only when their people come together, \\nhelping each other and working with a shared pur\\xad\\npose does their competitive strength grow.\\n\\u2003 In 2018, I started the “Oyaji no Kai,” a gathering of \\nexperienced technicians from across the Toyota \\nGroup. The aim of this gathering is to foster relation\\xad\\nships among technicians at different workplaces so \\nthat they call one another up to ask for advice and \\nhelp with front-line issues, such as personnel short\\xad\\nages and workload fluctuations. The group’s first \\nmeeting was just a casual dinner, but, being so \\nlike-minded, the participants quickly hit it off and real\\xad\\nly did start to help each other from the very next day. \\nNow, they are moving forward with efforts to \\nstrengthen relationships between front-line personnel \\nwithin Group companies. I think that such human \\nconnections will bolster the effectiveness of efforts to \\nhelp regions and businesses recover after natural \\ndisasters and other major disruptions, as well. \\n\\u2003 Sharing knowledge and experience can spark new \\ninsights, leading to developments and improvements \\nthat one person might never think of alone—I believe \\nthat alliances, should, in this way, create a whole that \\nis greater than the sum of its parts.\\n* \\x07\\nCASE: Connected, Autonomous/Automated, Shared, and Electric.\\nPeople: The Core of Manufacturing \\nAs individuals from different corporate cultures, with \\ndifferent ways of working, increasingly work alongside \\none another, it is vital that we candidly exchange views \\nand look for opportunities to combine our respective \\nstrengths. For this to work, each individual must be \\na\\xa0true professional. This entails cultivating both the \\nexpertise to swiftly make decisions based on the \\nKaizen mindset and leadership with a human touch to \\nhelp others understand and get them on board. \\n\\u2003 In 2019, I was appointed to the position of Chief \\nOfficer of the General Administration & Human \\nResources Group. Our current training and personnel \\nsystems developed during a period of corporate \\nexpansion, and I feel that they are now in need of sig\\xad\\nnificant revision. \\n\\u2003 Going forward, we will develop professionals with \\nthe following qualities, which are essential in this \\nonce-in-a-century transformational period.\\n\\ue050 \\x07\\nCan think proactively and take action\\n\\ue050 \\x07\\nCan take on new challenges see them through \\nto\\xa0conclusion\\n\\ue050 \\x07\\nConsider continuous self-improvement and \\n\\xad\\ncontinue to contribute throughout their career\\n\\u2003 We will advance rational, merit-based human \\nresource management, giving proper recognition to \\nthose who are doing well, regardless of academic \\nbackground, age, or formal qualifications. At the \\nsame time, we will firmly establish a corporate culture \\nin which everyone constantly seeks to surpass their \\nrole models and help nurture junior colleagues who \\nwill eventually surpass them.\\n\\u2003 However markets or industries may evolve, people \\nremain the core of manufacturing.

One of my favorite sayings is from \\nShingen Takeda, a prominent 16th century lord and \\ngeneral, and literally translates as “people are the \\nstone walls.” In other words, just as rocks of various \\nshapes and sizes can together form a strong stone \\nwall, developing and effectively deploying human \\nresources with diverse values and expertise is \\n\\xad\\nessential to building a strong company.\\n\\u2003 Management determines the Company’s strategy \\nand explains the hurdles that must be overcome to \\nbring out the best efforts of employees so that every\\xad\\none at Toyota will work hard and support one another \\nas a team. Employees hone their respective expertise \\nand carry out their responsibilities as professionals. \\nSuch daily efforts are the essential elements of \\nincreasing corporate value and the foundation that \\nsupports Toyota. \\nMy role as CFO and advisor to the president is to \\nkeep watch over Toyota’s overall management, \\nmaintain daily communication with the president, \\ncome up with ways to realize the president’s aspi\\xad\\nrations, priorities, and strategies, and give direc\\xad\\ntions as appropriate.\\n\\u2003 Sustainably increasing corporate value is the \\nduty of all companies. As a mobility company, \\nToyota is facing a once-in-a-century period of \\nprofound transformation and therefore must \\nadvance aggressive forward-looking investment \\nand business model innovation. Given this, I \\nwould like to share some of my thoughts on the \\nfactors that will be important to maintain and \\nincrease corporate value going forward.\\nCost Reduction, the TPS, \\nand Next-generation Investment\\nCost reduction and the Toyota Production System \\n(TPS) are Toyota’s core strengths and traditions, \\nhanded down from our predecessors. However, \\nI\\xa0think that we still have further to go to fully embrace \\nthe true essence of these.\\n\\u2003 Examining costs means examining actions. We \\ncarefully scrutinize every action, from each use of \\na\\xa0pencil by each individual all the way up to major \\nprojects, drawing on the full extent of our knowledge \\nand abilities to determine which parts of our actions \\nare wasteful so that we can improve them. When I \\nvisit Toyota’s worksites and talk with employees, I do \\nmy utmost to encourage them each to develop an \\nawareness of costs and a concrete view of the value \\nof specific things and actions. By implementing such \\nactivities globally, we are securing the funds to \\n\\xad\\nsustainably invest in electrification, automation, con\\xad\\nnectivity, and other next-generation technologies and \\nto accelerate investment in partner companies and \\nstart-ups.\\nMaximizing Group Competitiveness\\nThe Toyota Group has grown by building on the foun\\xad\\ndation laid by Kiichiro Toyoda and constantly pushing \\nto do better. The strength of the Toyota Group is in its \\nshared set of basic values. As we prepare to take on \\nnew rivals in as-yet unknown arenas, it is more \\nimportant than ever to return to the roots of the Group \\nand gather our full strength. By having each Group \\ncompany focus on its particular areas of expertise, we \\nwill further enhance our competitiveness. To do this, \\nwe are rebuilding our existing frameworks. I think that \\nthe common values shared by the companies of the \\nGroup are what will enable the success of the “home \\nand away” strategy espoused by President Toyoda. \\nTo achieve this strategy, we will reduce consolidated \\nfixed costs, streamline development and investment, \\nreinforce cost competitiveness, and advance human \\nresource development to achieve greater results from \\nthe efforts of the Group’s employees and thereby \\nincrease the corporate value of the Group as a whole.\\n\\u2003 Going forward, I will be sure to report the yearly \\nprogress and results of such initiatives to our inves\\xad\\ntors and shareholders.\\nKoji Kobayashi\\nExecutive Vice President,\\nMember of the Board of Directors\\nMessage from the CFO\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\n23\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n\\u2002 Transforming into a Mobility Company\\u2003 Recent Initiatives\\u2003 Organization\\u2003 Ever-better Cars\\u2003 Marketing\\u2003 GAZOO Racing\\u2003 Electrification\\u2003 Automated Driving\\u2003 Connected/MaaS\\u2003 Partner Robots\\u2003 Developing People\\u2003 Message from the CFO\\u2003 Capital Policy\\n100\\n50\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n\\x1f Interim dividend   \\x1f Year-end dividend   \\x1e Net income (right axis)\\nDividend per Share and Net Income\\n800\\n400\\n600\\n1,000\\n1,200\\n1,400\\n1,600\\n\\x1f Total amount of dividends*1   \\x1f Share repurchase for shareholder returns   \\x1f Share repurchase to avoid dilution of common shares\\nTotal Shareholder Return and Total Return Ratio\\n200\\n(Yen)\\n(Billions of yen)\\n(Billions of yen)\\n0\\n0\\n1,000\\n500\\n1,500\\n2,000\\n2,500\\n45\\n25\\n20\\n50\\n30\\n20\\n50\\n30\\n20\\n90\\n60\\n30\\n165\\n100\\n65\\n200\\n125\\n75\\n210\\n110\\n100\\n210\\n110\\n100\\n220\\n120\\n100\\n’10/3\\n’11/3\\n’12/3\\n’13/3\\n’14/3\\n’15/3\\n’16/3\\n’17/3\\n’18/3\\n’19/3\\n(Years ended)\\n220\\n220\\n120\\n100\\n1,800\\n631.3\\n293.3\\n647.9\\n639.3\\n349.9\\n632.4\\n449.9\\n1,186.8\\n’15/3\\n’16/3\\n’17/3\\n’18/3\\n’19/3\\n0\\n(Years ended)\\n650.1\\n549.9\\nRepurchase in connection with \\nthe issuance of First Series \\nModel AA Class Shares\\n636.7\\n550.0\\nTotal amount of payment \\n(billions of yen)\\n141.1\\n156.8\\n157.7\\n285.0\\n522.9\\n631.3\\n645.5\\n627.5\\n642.6\\n626.8\\nPayout ratio*\\n67.4%\\n38.4%\\n55.6%\\n29.6%\\n28.7%\\n29.0%\\n28.3%\\n34.6%\\n26.1%\\n33.8%\\n* Payout ratio: This is the ratio of (i) the amount of dividend per common share to (ii) net income attributable to Toyota Motor Corporation per common share.\\nTotal shareholder \\nreturn*2 (billions of yen)\\n924.6\\n1,287.2\\n1,082.4\\n1,200.1\\n1,186.8\\nTotal return ratio*2,3\\n42.5%\\n55.6%\\n59.1%\\n48.1%\\n63.0%\\n*1 \\x07\\nIncludes dividends paid to First Series Model AA Class Shares\\n*2 \\x07\\nExcluding repurchase made to avoid dilution of common shares.\\n*3 \\x07\\nTotal return ratio: This is the ratio of (i) the sum of dividends on both common shares and the First Series Model AA Class Shares \\nand the amount of repurchase of common shares for shareholder returns to (ii) net income attributable to Toyota Motor Corporation.\\nCapital Policy\\nFinancial Strategy\\nThree Pillars\\nThe three pillars of Toyota’s financial strategy are sta\\xad\\nbility, growth, and efficiency. By maintaining adequate \\nstability while pursuing growth and efficiency over the \\nmedium and long terms, we aim to build a robust \\nfinancial foundation to support sustainable growth.\\n1. Stability: Securing Liquidity\\nHaving experienced financial crises and the Great \\nEast Japan Earthquake, in order to ensure business \\ncontinuity in any business environment, we maintain \\na\\xa0sufficient level of liquidity to cover half a year of both \\nfixed costs in the automotive business and refinancing \\nrequirements in the financial services business.\\n\\u2003 Ample liquidity is essential to maintaining a full line-up \\nin each region and retaining the ability to respond to all \\noptions and opportunities in this era of profound trans\\xad\\nformation in mobility. As such, it is a vital part of the \\nfoundation supporting the creation of corporate value.\\n2. Growth: Aggressive Forward-looking Investment\\nThe auto industry is on the verge of a once-in-\\xad\\n\\na-\\xad\\ncentury turning point. We believe that technological \\ninnovation in such areas as connected technologies, \\nautomated driving, sharing, and electrification will be \\nkey to the mobility of the future. Every year, we spend \\nmore than 1 trillion yen on R&D. By enhancing \\n\\xad\\nefficiency in existing areas, we are strategically \\nincreasing the portion of R&D spending allotted to \\ncutting-edge fields like the above.\\n\\u2003 We are advancing a wide range of investment \\n\\xad\\ninitiatives aimed at reinforcing competitiveness. These \\ninclude investments in start-ups through the Mirai \\nCreation Fund and Toyota AI Ventures; funding for \\nour business tie-up partners, such as Grab and Uber; \\nthe joint funding of MONET with SoftBank; and \\ninvestments in Uber ATG, Uber’s automated driving \\ngroup, DiDi, and other companies.\\n3. Efficiency: Enhancing Capital Efficiency\\nUsing cost reduction and the thorough application of \\nthe TPS, we are reinforcing the profit structure and \\nsecuring funds to invest in advanced and \\n\\xad\\ncutting-edge technologies.\\n\\u2003 In capital expenditures other than R&D expenses, as \\nwell, we are carefully assigning priority to individual \\n\\xad\\nprojects and tracking their progress while advancing \\nmeasures to improve productivity, such as streamlining \\ndevelopment in existing fields, making equipment more \\ncompact, shortening processes, and facilitating faster \\nresponse to changes in production quantities.\\n\\u2003 Furthermore, in addition to sustainably increasing ROE \\nby repurchasing shares, we are strengthening invest\\xad\\nment management by regularly evaluating the rationality \\nof our strategic shareholdings in terms of the needs of \\nour business strategies and economic utility. In these \\nways, we are striving to enhance capital efficiency.\\nDiversifying Our Funding Base\\nTo diversify our means of funding, in 2015 Toyota \\nissued approximately 500 billion yen in Model AA \\nclass shares to raise funds for long-term R&D activi\\xad\\nties and build a base of medium- and long-term \\nshareholders. The funds raised are being invested in \\nR&D related to advanced and cutting-edge technolo\\xad\\ngies, such as fuel cells, infrastructure, information \\ntechnology, and highly intelligent mobility.\\n\\u2003 In 2019, Toyota issued straight bonds worth 50.0 bil\\xad\\nlion yen in Japan and 1.5 billion USD overseas. We are \\nusing the proceeds from these for as operating capital \\nand for capital expenditures. Through such measures, \\nwe are diversifying our funding base to ensure that we \\ncan respond on all fronts to new challenges and oppor\\xad\\ntunities in this time of profound transformation in mobility.\\nShareholder Return\\nWe prioritize shareholder return as part of our capital \\npolicy. In principle, shareholder return is determined \\non the basis of net income.\\n\\u2003 We strive to maintain stable and sustainable divi\\xad\\ndend payments based on a benchmark consolidated \\ndividend payout ratio of 30%. For the fiscal year \\nended March 31, 2019, we paid an annual dividend \\nof 220 yen per share.\\n\\u2003 We flexibly repurchase shares to improve capital \\nefficiency based on a comprehensive consideration \\nof such factors as liquidity on hand and the share \\nprice. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we \\npaid out 550.0 billion yen for the repurchase of \\nshares, resulting in a total of 80 million shares \\nacquired. Combined with dividends, this brought the \\ntotal annual shareholder return to 1,186.8 billion yen, \\nfor a consolidated payout ratio of 63.0%.\\n\\u2003 Going forward, we will strive to further improve net \\nincome and ensure ongoing shareholder return \\nthrough dividends and share repurchases.\\n24\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nWorking with Global Society\\nIn cooperation with global society, Toyota is working \\nto contribute to the sustainable development of soci\\xad\\nety and the planet through its business activities.

In response, we are advancing initiatives to \\nencourage all employees to return to Toyota’s founda\\xad\\ntions—the Five Main Principles of Toyoda—and \\n\\xad\\nreexamine the mindsets and approaches that they \\nbring to their work. \\n\\u2003 The Guiding Principles at Toyota lay out the kind of \\ncompany we want to be. Building on this, the Toyota \\nWay 2001 (hereinafter called the “Toyota Way”) was \\nestablished in 2001, laying out values and business \\npractices that everyone working at Toyota around the \\nworld should embrace. The Toyota Way thus clearly \\narticulates and facilitates the global sharing of values \\nand practices that had previously been passed down \\nonly as implicit knowledge.\\n\\u2003 The Toyota Way’s main pillars are the concepts of con\\xad\\ntinuous improvement and respect for people, with the \\nkeywords of taking on challenges, Kaizen (Continuous \\nimprovement), and Genchi Genbutsu (onsite, hands-on \\nexperience) under the former and respect and teamwork \\nunder the latter.

The Board of Directors \\ndecides on total compensation for a given fiscal year \\nand delegates the determination of the amount of \\ncompensation for each Member of the Board of \\nDirectors to the Executive Compensation Meeting. \\nThe Executive Compensation Meeting reviews the \\ncompensation system for Members of the Board of \\nDirectors and determines compensation for each \\nMember of the Board of Directors, taking into \\naccount such factors as corporate performance and \\nindividual job responsibilities and performance.\\n\\u2003 Compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board \\nMembers is determined by the Audit & Supervisory \\nBoard within the scope determined by resolution of \\nthe Shareholders’ Meeting.

Specifically, annual total compensation is \\ndetermined for each rank based on consolidated \\noperating income and the volatility of Toyota’s share \\nprice, and then adjusted for each member based on \\ntheir individual performance evaluation. This adjust\\xad\\nment is limited to a range of 10% above or below the \\nannual total compensation for each rank.\\n2) \\x07\\nDirectors with non-Japanese citizenship \\n(excluding Outside Directors)\\nFixed compensation and performance-based com\\xad\\npensation are set at levels and in structures that allow \\nToyota to secure and retain talented personnel. Fixed \\ncompensation is determined with regard to each \\nmember’s job responsibilities and the compensation \\nstandards of said individual’s home country. \\nPerformance-based compensation is determined \\nwith reference to consolidated operating income, the \\nvolatility of Toyota’s share price and the individuals’ \\nperformance, taking into account job responsibilities \\nand the compensation standards of said individual’s \\nhome country. Toyota’s approach to these parame\\xad\\nters is the same as for directors with Japanese citi\\xad\\nzenship (excluding Outside Directors).\\nShare Compensation System\\nToyota’s Board of Directors decides the amount of \\nannual share compensation, within the maximum (4.0 \\nbillion yen per year) set by the 115th Ordinary General \\nShareholders’ Meeting held on June 13, 2019.\\nAnalysis and Evaluation of the \\nEffectiveness of the Board of Directors\\nPursuant to the instruction of the Chairman of the \\nBoard of Directors, after the Secretariat of the Board \\nof Directors conducts a quantitative analysis of the \\nstate of the Board’s performance, a survey is con\\xad\\nducted of the participants of Board of Directors meet\\xad\\nings (Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & \\nSupervisory Board Members) regarding the state of \\nexecution of operations and of the supervision of \\nsuch execution.\\n\\u2003 Based on results of the survey, interviews are held \\nindividually with the participants of Board of Directors \\nmeetings, including the Outside Directors and \\nOutside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The \\nSecretariat of the Board of Directors compiles and \\nexplains the findings to the Chairman of the Board of \\nDirectors, then reports them to the Board of Directors \\nfor discussion.\\n\\u2003 The evaluation of performance in fiscal 2019 con\\xad\\nfirmed that effectiveness was secured. Nevertheless, \\nworthy comments were provided during the evaluation \\nprocess regarding the acceleration of decision making, \\nmanagement oversight of operations, and other mat\\xad\\nters. Toyota will act on these to make improvements in \\nfiscal 2020 to further enhance effectiveness.\\nFundamental Approach and Maintenance \\nof Internal Control Systems\\nBasic Stance on System for Ensuring Appropriate \\nBusiness Operations\\nToyota and its subsidiaries work to foster a sound \\ncorporate culture based on the Guiding Principles at \\nToyota and the Toyota Code of Conduct.

He has also stated that every employee must grasp the \\nopportunity of “Start Your Impossible.”\\n\\u2003 Coming from the sports world, I am particularly attracted to the Toyota \\nprinciples of the Spirit of Challenge, Teamwork and Respect which when \\ncombined with Kaizen and Genchi Genbutsu, should mean we know no \\nboundaries to our future progress.\\n\\u2003 My particular interests have concentrated on two major areas.  Firstly, HR \\nand my desire to help devise a more open style of management which will \\nensure faster, more agile two-way communication between all workforce \\nmembers. Secondly, Toyota has such a lead in mass hybridisation, but I am \\nconcerned and want to encourage TMC to make sure there is enough sup\\xad\\nply as governments and regions wake up to hybrid and electrification. We \\nmust maximize the opportunities that Toyota + Lexus started!\\n\\u2003 Finally, I wish to state that I am very happy in my function as an Outside \\nBoard Director of TMC and can report on a most interesting and productive \\nteamwork ethic with my two fellow Outside Board Directors.\\nOver the past year, as the changes in the environment of the auto industry \\nintensify, Toyota has swiftly made many significant decisions, such as form\\xad\\ning alliances and executing major investments around the world. In the \\ncourse of making such decisions, I believe that the discussions of the Board \\nof Directors have come to be far more active than ever before.\\n\\u2003 Recently, in addition to the Outside Directors and the Directors in charge \\nof specific items being discussed, the President and all members of the \\nBoard have frankly voiced their opinions from a Company-wide, long-term \\nperspective. This is becoming the norm at Board of Directors meetings. \\n\\u2003 Part of the reason for this is the understanding permeating among the \\nCompany’s executives that if Toyota does not squarely face its weaknesses \\nand correctly understand the changes going on around it, it may not make it \\nto the other side of this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation. \\nFurthermore, a shift in approach, to more proactively incorporate outside \\nviews and flexibly adjust plans as needed, is becoming apparent. For exam\\xad\\nple, separate from Board of Directors meetings, every month, the Outside \\nDirectors and other relevant executives meet to examine the Company’s \\nresponse to long-term issues. \\n\\u2003 Toyota will continue to take on new challenges in order to survive in this \\nnew era, and no matter what, I am sure that it will continue to move forward.\\nOver the past year, I have taken part in Toyota’s management from an out\\xad\\nside perspective. Uninvolved in business execution, I considered how Toyota \\ncan remain irreplaceable to society while sustainably growing and whether \\nToyota’s corporate conduct aligns with societal norms and values. \\n\\u2003 Toyota is changing.\\n\\u2003 Management and employees are aligning their efforts, driven by a strong \\nsense of urgency and purpose to further enhance the operational excellence \\nthey have built together and transform Toyota into a mobility service compa\\xad\\nny brimming with creativity. \\n\\u2003 Toyota’s drive to manufacture trustworthy cars continues unaltered. \\nHowever, Toyota is working quickly and flexibly to create new value, unafraid of \\ndiscarding previous approaches, based on a serious examination of how it can \\ndeliver services that will create a better society from the user’s perspective. \\n\\u2003 Drawing on its robust financial base, outstanding and passionate employ\\xad\\nees, and the social trust it enjoys, Toyota will deliver exciting cars and high \\nquality mobility services to its customers. I intend to do my part to help \\nToyota move steadily forward in these endeavors.\\nSir Philip Craven\\nTeiko Kudo\\nIkuro Sugawara\\n\\u2002 Initiatives for Sustainable Growth\\u2003

With the goal of contributing to sustainable \\ndevelopment, we place value on all stakeholders in \\nthe management of our businesses, endeavoring to \\nbuild and maintain sound relationships with them \\nthrough open and fair communication.\\nHuman Rights, the Essential Foundation of \\nLabor\\xa0Relations\\nToyota respects the basic human rights of all individu\\xad\\nals, including employees and those in the supply \\nchain. Toyota practices the philosophy of “respect for \\npeople,” which is based on the shared belief that \\nevery Toyota employee possesses an unlimited \\ncapacity for the betterment of themselves, the \\nCompany, and society. The cumulative efforts of our \\nemployees are what drive corporate growth, thereby \\nenabling improvement in working conditions and \\nenvironments and building employee trust, which, in \\nturn, enables further growth and improvement.\\n\\u2003 We strive to ensure safe, healthy, and inclusive \\nwork environments that are free of discrimination and \\nharassment and in which each employee’s dignity \\nand diverse values are respected. Each employee’s \\ncontribution to the creation of such workplaces is \\nessential to achieving the productivity improvements \\nnecessary for corporate growth. Discriminatory, \\nunhealthy, or unsafe work environments are not only \\nviolations of human rights, they negatively impact \\nemployee performance. Recognizing the irreplace\\xad\\nable value of the time our employees choose to share \\nwith Toyota, we aim to create positive working condi\\xad\\ntions and environments that will allow them to excel.\\n\\u2003 Moreover, the contributions and cooperation of all \\nour stakeholders are essential to providing products \\nand services that satisfy our customers. Our car \\nmaking over the decades has been made possible \\nthanks to the support of our many stakeholders. \\nGoing forward, Toyota will continue to work hand-in-\\nhand with employees and respect all its stakehold\\xad\\ners as it continues to contribute to society as a \\nmobility company.\\n\\u2003 At present, with our customers’ needs and the very \\nconcept of automobiles constantly changing, Toyota \\nis endeavoring to transform itself from an automobile \\ncompany to a mobility company, that is, a provider of \\nall kinds of mobility-related services. As we face new \\ncompetitors and an evolving business domain, based \\non the management philosophy of “respect for \\n\\xad\\npeople,” Toyota’s employees are each harnessing \\ntheir knowledge and giving their best efforts to help \\nthe Company survive in an environment marked by \\nconstant, major change. To meet the expectations of \\nour stakeholders, we also refer to international \\nnorms, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles \\non Business and Human Rights and the Universal \\nDeclaration of Human Rights, to tackle issues related \\nto human rights.\\nUnited Nations Guiding Principles \\nReporting Framework\\nToyota has formulated an internal policy related to \\nhuman rights and, in implementing it, refers to the UN \\nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights \\nand other international norms. To fulfill our responsi\\xad\\nbility to respect human rights, we have identified cer\\xad\\ntain risks vis-à-vis our operations adversely impacting \\nhuman rights as priority issues based on such factors \\nas the scale and character of our businesses, the \\npossibility of mitigation, and stakeholder expectations. \\nCurrently, we have identified three areas—freedom of \\nassociation, precarious work, and supply chain due \\ndiligence—in which certain of our operations are at \\nrisk of adversely impacting human rights and are \\nworking to address them as a matter of top priority. \\n\\u2003 In addition, Toyota has developed the Toyota \\nSupplier CSR Guidelines based on the UN Guiding \\nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights and the \\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights.\\nThree Priority Areas\\nFreedom of Association\\nIn accordance with Toyota’s “respect for people” \\nmanagement philosophy, we aim to respect and fully \\nutilize individuals’ capabilities, ability to think, and cre\\xad\\nativity. To this end, it is necessary to ensure a shared \\nunderstanding among all employees of the Company’s \\nmanagement situation, business environment, and \\nmanagement issues. We therefore emphasize thor\\xad\\nough dialogue with employees. In addition, based on \\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we \\nrespect our employees’ right to freely associate while \\nalso respecting their right not to be compelled to \\nbelong to an association in compliance with the laws \\nof the countries in which we operate.\\n\\u2003 Regardless of the presence or absence of labor \\nunions, Toyota takes every opportunity it can to \\nengage in thorough dialogue with employees and build \\nsound labor-management relations. We believe that \\nsuch relations encompass dialogue and discussion \\nwith employees or their appropriate representatives.\\n\\u2003 Moreover, to ascertain the status of dialogue with \\nemployees and issues related to freedom of associa\\xad\\ntion, we periodically send out and collect question\\xad\\nnaires from our subsidiaries and request improvements \\nto policies and activities based on the responses as \\nneeded. For affiliates that require concentrated initia\\xad\\ntives, associates from TMC are dispatched to review \\nthe affiliate’s policies and activities and work together \\nto enhance communication with and training for \\nemployees regarding Toyota’s policies concerning \\n\\xad\\nfreedom of association and legal compliance.\\nPrecarious Work\\nThe term “non-permanent workers” includes tempo\\xad\\nrary workers, contract employees, and dispatch \\nemployees. Non-permanent status is marked by a \\nnumber of forms of uncertainty and instability, such \\nas uncertain employment periods, low wages, and \\npoor employee benefits. Our businesses require per\\xad\\nsonnel equipped with both a deep understanding of \\nToyota’s values and advanced skills. Because culti\\xad\\nvating such personnel requires a great deal of time, \\nToyota strives to provide stable employment even \\nwhen the external environment is challenging. At the \\nsame time, Toyota is engaged in the automobile \\nindustry, in which demand is greatly influenced by \\nnew product releases and seasonal factors. \\nAccordingly, to respond to such fluctuations, the \\nCompany directly and indirectly hires a certain \\n\\xad\\nnumber of temporary personnel.\\n\\u2003 As such, each of our affiliates bases its hiring of \\nnon-permanent workers on the prevailing customs \\nand labor laws of its respective region, and Toyota \\nstrives to avoid inappropriate working conditions and \\nemployment. First, we confirm the composition of \\nemployees at our affiliates in each country and \\n\\xad\\nidentify affiliates requiring prioritized examination of \\nnon-permanent employment relationships. Associates \\nfrom TMC are dispatched to affiliates thus identified \\nand, if deemed necessary, implement improvements, \\nsuch as reassignments and changes to employment \\nrules related to contract terms. In addition, we review \\nand seek to continuously improve the working condi\\xad\\ntions of fixed-term contract employees at TMC itself.\\nSupply Chain Due Diligence\\nA single automobile comprises approximately 30,000 \\nparts, necessitating extremely broad and deep supply \\nchains. As such, we recognize preventing adverse \\nimpacts on human rights in our supply chains as a \\npriority. Accordingly, we hold workshops for suppliers \\nthat are particularly large and would be difficult \\nreplace in which we share issues to be wary of \\nand\\xa0examples of solutions.\\n\\u2003 Toyota adheres to the principle of mutual trust and \\nmutual responsibility between labor and management \\nand aims to collaborate with suppliers to contribute \\nto sustainable societal development as well as the \\nearth’s sustainability. Toyota also strives to comply \\nwith the laws of the countries and regions it operates \\nin while protecting human rights and contributing to \\nboth local communities and the international community.\\nConflict Minerals Issues\\nToyota has adopted the Policies and Approaches \\nto\\xa0Conflict Minerals Issues, which it applies as \\na\\xa0set\\xa0of guidelines when tackling conflict mineral\\xad\\nrelated issues.\\n\\u2003 Please see the content linked to below for informa\\xad\\ntion about activities in 2018.\\nToyota’s Approaches to Conflict Minerals Issues \\n(Sustainability Data Book 2019, p. 25)\\nWEB\\nCollaboration with Suppliers \\n(Sustainability Data Book 2019, p. 26)\\nWEB\\nRespect for Human Rights \\n(Sustainability Data Book 2019, p. 23)\\nWEB\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n34\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nEmployees\\n\\u2002 Initiatives for Sustainable Growth\\u2003 \\x07\\nCorporate Philosophy\\u2003 Corporate Governance\\u2003 Messages from the Outside Directors\\u2003 Toyota Environmental Challenge\\u2003 Respect for Human Rights and SCM\\u2003 Employees\\u2003 Risk Management\\u2003 Compliance\\u2003 \\nCustomer First and Quality First\\u2003 Working to Better the World around Us\\nToyota prioritizes respect for people, aiming to \\nprovide employees with opportunities to make \\nsocial contributions and realize self actualization \\nthrough their work and to allow them to exercise \\ntheir ability to think, create, and take action.\\n\\u2003 To achieve this goal, a relationship of mutual \\ntrust and mutual responsibility between labor and \\nmanagement is essential. In such a relationship, \\nToyota places the highest priority on ensuring \\nstable employment for its employees and proac\\xad\\ntively strives to improve labor conditions, while \\nemployees do their utmost to enhance the pros\\xad\\nperity of the Company. This philosophy is shared \\nby all Toyota affiliates around the world and, \\ntogether with considerations for regional charac\\xad\\nteristics, is reflected and implemented in Toyota’s \\nmanagement and policies.\\n\\u2003 Toyota believes that this approach leads not \\nonly to management that operates with respect \\nfor people, but to customer satisfaction and \\nsocial contribution and thus to the sustainable \\ngrowth of both the Company and society.\\nSafety and Health\\nFundamental Approach\\nEnsuring the safety and health of employees has been \\none of Toyota’s most important long-standing business \\nactivities and will continue to be so going forward.\\n\\u2003 Toyota believes that creating safe and healthy work \\nenvironments will lead to productivity improvements \\nof the Company necessary for corporate growth. \\n\\u2003 In 1957, Senior Managing Director Eiji Toyoda \\nexplained his fundamental approach to health and \\nsafety as “Safe work is the ‘gate’ to all work. Let us \\npass through this gate.” These words still ring true \\ntoday and are part of our Basic Philosophy for Safety \\nand Health. In 2017, Toyota announced its \\n“Proclamation of Health Commitment: Aiming at \\nBecoming a Health-first Company,” under which it is \\nadvancing a wide range of initiatives to promote health.\\n\\u2003 When advancing initiatives in safety and health, we \\nensure that they conform to workplace needs while \\nmaking iterative improvements through the PDCA \\ncycle. Toyota’s manager in charge of Company-wide \\nsafety and health (operating officer) takes the lead in \\nformulating priority policies, and related KPIs are reg\\xad\\nularly reported to Executive Meetings and considered \\nimportant metrics to be monitored by management. \\nGlobal Safety Measures\\nToyota regional headquarters take the lead in promot\\xad\\ning safety and health measures in each region. We \\nare currently working with each region to develop an \\noccupational safety and health management system \\n(OSHMS) globally. Along with unique regional require\\xad\\nments, we have established requirements that are \\nshared globally throughout Toyota based on ISO \\n45001.* Using OSHMS, weaknesses are identified by \\nGenchi Genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience) to \\nimprove safety management.\\n* \\x07\\nISO 45001: The international standard related to occupational safety \\nand health management systems established by the ISO (International \\nOrganization for Standardization)\\nHuman Resource Development\\nFundamental Approach\\nToyota is committed to developing human resources \\nin accordance with its philosophy that monozukuri \\n(manufacturing) is about developing people. In order \\nto sustain growth, it is essential to utilize the wisdom \\nof our people to make constant improvements.\\n\\u2003 At the same time, while employees bring a wide \\nrange of cultures and customs, to make ever-better \\ncars and carry out our Customer First policy, all \\nemployees must share certain values.\\n\\u2003 To this end, Toyota is implementing human \\nresource development aimed at sustainable growth \\nthrough a global educational program centered on \\nthe application of the Toyota Way. On-the-job training \\n(OJT) is the foundation of this program.\\nEvaluation of and Feedback to \\nEach\\xa0Employee in Relation to \\nPrinciples\\xa0and Policies\\nThe daily work (topics and roles) of Toyota employees \\nis derived from annual policies. Evaluation and feed\\xad\\nback are based on close communications between \\nsubordinates and superiors.\\n\\u2003 Specifically, topics and roles are determined at the \\nbeginning of each fiscal year and employees consult \\nwith their supervisors periodically. Through these \\nconsultations, supervisors assess the employees’ \\nself-\\xad\\nevaluations and provide feedback. Repeating this \\ncycle leads to human resource development. Results for \\neach half year are reflected in bonuses and performance \\nabilities are reflected in raises for the following year.\\nDeveloping Executives Globally\\nThe GLOBAL 21 program is aimed at developing \\nexecutives globally. The program serves to enable \\noutstanding human resources from around the world \\nto obtain the skills and discernment expected of \\nglobal-level Toyota executives and to fully realize their \\nindividual strengths in their respective roles. The pro\\xad\\ngram consists of the following three pillars.\\n1.\\t \\x07\\nEnsuring understanding of our management philoso\\xad\\nphy and the expectations of executives\\n\\t\\n\\x07\\nWe are applying the Toyota Way and Toyota Global Vision, \\nincorporating them into global personnel evaluation sys\\xad\\ntems and education.\\n2.\\t \\x07\\nPersonnel management\\n\\t\\n\\x07\\nWe are unifying evaluation standards and processes glob\\xad\\nally to ensure fairness and consistency. Our main evalua\\xad\\ntion criteria are individuals’ ability to set tasks, carry out \\ntasks, manage their organization, and effectively utilize \\nhuman resources as well as the level of trust and respect \\nthat others have for them.\\n3.\\t \\x07\\nDevelopment framework and education programs\\n\\t\\n\\x07\\nWe are allocating human resources and developing execu\\xad\\ntives globally. Our development of human resources at \\noverseas affiliates is based on education conducted by affil\\xad\\niates in each region, with OJT at TMC so that participants \\ncan learn Toyota-style ways of working. In addition, we are \\nimplementing a program similar to GLOBAL 21 for employees \\nof TMC in Japan.\\nGlobal human resources\\nGlobal Executive Human Resource Development \\nGlobal 21 Program\\nToyota \\nhuman resources\\nOverseas affiliate \\nhuman resources\\nEmployees (Safety and Health, \\nSustainability Data Book 2019, p. 32)\\nWEB\\nToyota Way 2001\\nWEB\\nEmployees (Human Resource Development, \\nSustainability Data Book 2019, p. 35)\\nWEB\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n35\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nEmployees\\n\\u2002 Initiatives for Sustainable Growth\\u2003 \\x07\\nCorporate Philosophy\\u2003 Corporate Governance\\u2003 Messages from the Outside Directors\\u2003 Toyota Environmental Challenge\\u2003 Respect for Human Rights and SCM\\u2003 Employees\\u2003 Risk Management\\u2003 Compliance\\u2003 \\nCustomer First and Quality First\\u2003 Working to Better the World around Us\\nDiversity and Inclusion\\nFundamental Approach\\nOur strengths lie in our capacity to respect our \\nemployees’ abilities to think and promote reforms \\ninvolving every member.\\n\\u2003 Recent technical innovations centered on CASE* are \\npropelling Toyota to transform from a car company \\ninto a mobility company. We believe such a transfor\\xad\\nmation is becoming increasingly important as we are \\nexpected to continue creating innovations steadily in \\nexisting areas while taking on challenges in new areas.\\n\\u2003 In such an environment, we consider diversity and \\ninclusion to be one of the key bases of management \\nand are working to create an attractive workplace \\nwhere employees with wide-ranging skills and values \\ncan demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and \\nachieve self-realization.\\n\\u2003 In order to become a company that will be needed \\nand chosen by society, we are promoting collabora\\xad\\ntion with a wide variety of partners both inside and \\noutside the Company while putting into practice the \\nvalues Toyota has embraced since its founding, such \\nas the attitude of humbly learning and taking on chal\\xad\\nlenges from the customer’s viewpoint.\\n* \\x07\\nCASE: Connected, Autonomous/Automated, Shared, and Electric.\\nPromoting Women’s Participation in the \\nWorkplace (Japan)\\nIn promoting diversity and inclusion, we recognize that \\ngender diversity has been an issue, particularly at \\nToyota. In 2002, we started initiatives at Toyota centered \\non expanding and establishing measures to support \\nwomen who are trying to balance work and childrearing. \\nThen in 2012, we began focusing on initiatives for \\ncreating a work environment that would help motivate \\nwomen and supporting their greater participation \\n\\xad\\n(especially the development of female managers).\\nSupport Measures for Balancing Work and Childcare\\nFor those planning to take maternity leave, we have \\nbeen offering pre-maternity leave seminars and super\\xad\\nvisor career interviews since 2015. The goals of these \\ninitiatives are to ease the participants’ concerns about \\nbalancing work and childcare and to raise the level of \\ndesire to continue growing after returning to work, as \\nwell. The participants evaluate their career plans and \\nhow best to achieve them, hear about other employ\\xad\\nees who successfully balanced work with family in the \\npast, and participate in roundtable discussions.\\nCareer Development Support Measures\\nIn 2019, we introduced a career workshop targeting \\nfemale employees and their supervisors. We are \\n\\xad\\npromoting the continued growth of female employees \\nthrough various measures, including supporting long-\\nterm career building with life events taken into con\\xad\\nsideration, providing advice to supervisors on how to \\nguide their subordinates, and facilitating dialogue \\nbetween supervisors and subordinates.\\nInitiatives Related to Persons with Disabilities\\nInitiatives in Japan\\nBased on the concept of a harmonious society, in \\nwhich all persons with or without disabilities work and \\nlive together in harmony, we provide various work \\nopportunities to those with disabilities. We offer a \\nrange of support to enable persons with disabilities to \\nwork energetically by fully utilizing their abilities.\\n\\u2003 For example, we have assigned a job consultant to \\neach office, created a consultation hotline that \\nensures privacy, and introduced a special holiday \\nsystem that can be used by employees for going to \\nthe hospital or other clinics. Furthermore, to ensure \\nthat persons with disabilities are given fair \\nopportunities, we send in sign language interpreters, \\nprovide a variety of support tools, and make work\\xad\\nplace improvements as needed.\\n\\u2003 In terms of facilities, we are creating workplaces \\nwith improved accessibility as needed by, for exam\\xad\\nple, providing handicapped parking spaces and uni\\xad\\nversally accessible toilets.\\n\\u2003 For those workplaces hiring employees with dis\\xad\\nabilities, we distribute guidebooks to help other \\nemployees better understand disabilities and gain the \\nknowledge necessary for providing support.\\n\\u2003 In addition, to cultivate a workplace-wide culture, we \\nhave implemented “Emotional Barrier-free Training” tar\\xad\\ngeting a wide range of employees, from new employees \\nto senior professionals/senior management, to promote \\nunderstanding of and empathy for people with disabilities.\\n\\u2003 As of June 2019, the number of persons with dis\\xad\\nabilities employed was 1,322 accounting for 2.33% of \\nthe entire workforce (including special-purpose subsid\\xad\\niaries) which is above the legal requirement of 2.2%.\\nCreating an Environment Where the Disabled Can \\nWork with Confidence\\nToyota Loops Corporation began operation in April \\n2009 with 28 people with disabilities, and received \\ncertification from the Minister of Health, Labour and \\nWelfare as a special-purpose subsidiary of Toyota in \\nOctober of that year. \\n\\u2003 As of June 2019, Toyota Loops employed 256 per\\xad\\nsons with disabilities performing a variety of office \\nsupport work. \\n\\u2003 The number of support staff has also been \\nincreased to accommodate the hiring of more per\\xad\\nsons with disabilities, and also to eliminate or reduce \\nThailand: Toyota Safe Driving Campaign implemented in cooperation \\nwith organizations that help people with disabilities\\nanxieties that employees may have regarding their \\nhealth or work.  \\n\\u2003 We actively exchange information with governmen\\xad\\ntal bodies, local communities, and social welfare \\norganizations to create working environments where \\neach employee can work with confidence.\\nGlobal Initiatives\\nWe are striving to create a workplace environment \\nthat is friendly even to employees with disabilities by, \\nfor example, providing universally accessible toilets, \\nhandicapped parking spaces, and wheelchair ramps. \\nWe also conduct a variety of events, for example, \\nparticipating in campaigns and holding workshops, to \\npromote understanding about people with disabilities.\\nToyota Loops employees competing in the Abilympics\\nAustralia: Mr. Dylan Alcott, a wheelchair tennis champ, \\npresents a workshop called “Champions of Change”\\nToyota is advancing measures to empower women at affiliates in each region. \\nToyota Motor Europe \\n(Belgium)\\nToyota Daihatsu \\nEngineering & \\nManufacturing Co., \\nLtd.

Their corporate targets have expanded \\nfrom confidential information and information sys\\xad\\ntems to include systems that control plants and \\nvehicles, such as those for on-board devices. \\nInformation security is thus an increasingly import\\xad\\nant priority for Toyota.\\n\\u2003 Toyota considers ensuring the safety and peace \\nof mind of its customers as well as protecting its \\ncustomers’ personal information and other assets \\nto be its social responsibility.\\n\\u2003 Toyota has established an Information Security \\nPolicy that clearly lays out Toyota’s basic approach \\nto information security and related initiatives to facil\\xad\\nitate united information security initiatives by TMC \\nand its consolidated subsidiaries. Based on this \\npolicy, we are advancing a range of initiatives to \\nreinforce information security from the perspectives \\nof governance and risk management.\\nFundamental Approach\\nToyota has been working to reinforce its risk manage\\xad\\nment systems since the series of recall issues in \\n2010. In June 2010, Toyota established the Risk \\nManagement Committee (now the Sustainability \\nMeeting) and appointed risk managers for the global \\ngroup and each region and business section as part \\nof global measures to prevent and mitigate the \\nimpact of risks that could arise in the course of busi\\xad\\nness activities.\\nOrganization and Structure\\nToyota has appointed a global chief risk officer (CRO) \\nto head global risk management.

A booklet containing the Toyota Code \\nof Conduct is distributed to all employees.\\n\\u2003 In addition, the Sustainability Meeting discusses \\nthe expectations of stakeholders and Toyota’s \\nresponses to various social issues. In particular, the \\nmeeting deliberates and receives reports on matters \\nrelated to compliance.\\nChecks to Enhance Compliance\\nIn fiscal 2009, Toyota began implementing internal \\nchecks to enhance its compliance structure. In fiscal \\n2010 these checks were extended to subsidiaries in \\nand outside Japan. Since then, these checks have \\nbeen carried out and improved upon every year. \\nResults are reported to the Sustainability Meeting \\nand\\xa0used as a basis for further improvement. By \\nincorporating improvement initiatives into each year’s \\naction plans, we ensure that these checks lead to \\nongoing positive action.\\n\\u2003 Moreover, Toyota holds meetings with subsidiaries \\nin order to keep track of their compliance efforts and \\nprovide them support as needed.\\nThe Compliance Hotline\\nToyota uses hotlines to quickly and fairly address \\na\\xa0wide range of employee concerns, complaints, and \\nquestions. Through a contracted external law firm, \\nwe have set up a compliance hotline that employees \\ncan consult regarding compliance-related questions. \\nWe strive to ensure awareness of this hotline through \\nsuch efforts as distributing cards with the hotline’s \\ncontact information to all employees and periodically \\nputting up signs in company cafeterias. \\n\\u2003 The identity of the employees using the hotline can, \\nat their request, be kept anonymous, and every effort \\nis taken to ensure that the individual need not worry \\nabout being identified. Regarding potential issues, the \\nlaw firm contacts the relevant internal divisions, which \\nthen investigate and quickly take steps to address \\nany problems identified. Once the facts of the situa\\xad\\ntion have been confirmed, problems thus discovered \\nare dealt with appropriately in accordance with the \\nrules of employment and other internal rules. \\nCompliance\\nEnsuring Compliance\\nTo ensure that awareness of compliance extends \\nfrom top management all the way to each and every \\nemployee, Toyota conducts training programs for \\ndirectors and executives, managers, and new hires \\nas well as Company-wide e-learning programs.\\n\\u2003 In addition to standard legal topics, such as labor \\nlaw, antimonopoly law, and subcontracting law, we \\nconduct seminars covering bribery prevention, per\\xad\\nsonal information protection, the Product Liability \\nAct, and other topics. \\n\\u2003 In addition, based on specific needs, the Legal \\nDivision conducts onsite seminars on a wide range \\nof topics at individual divisions.\\nMain Training Themes to Date\\n• Contracts\\n• \\x07\\nThe Act against Unjustifiable \\nPremiums and Misleading \\nRepresentations\\n• \\x07\\nIntellectual property \\n(trademarks)\\n• \\x07\\nConfidentiality management\\n• Labor\\n• Antimonopoly law\\n• \\x07\\nInsider trading regulations\\n• The Product Liability Act\\n• Bribery prevention\\n• \\x07\\nExport operations \\nmanagement\\n• Subcontracting law\\n• Copyright\\n• \\x07\\nThe Act on the Protection of \\nPersonal Information\\n• Taxes\\n• Safety and health\\n\\u2002 Initiatives for Sustainable Growth\\u2003 \\x07\\nCorporate Philosophy\\u2003 Corporate Governance\\u2003 Messages from the Outside Directors\\u2003 Toyota Environmental Challenge\\u2003 Respect for Human Rights and SCM\\u2003 Employees\\u2003 Risk Management\\u2003 Compliance\\u2003 \\nCustomer First and Quality First\\u2003 Working to Better the World around Us\\nToyota Code of Conduct\\nWEB\\nCompliance Check\\nWithin Toyota (HQ)\\nSubsidiary\\nSecond-tier Subsidiary\\nSecretariat and \\nspecialized divisions\\nDivisions managing subsidiaries\\nIndividual \\ndivisions\\nSelf improvement\\nSelf-\\ninspections\\nIncorporation \\ninto policy\\nSelf-\\ninspections\\nIncorporation \\ninto policy\\nSelf-\\ninspections\\nIncorporation \\ninto policy\\nSelf improvement\\nP\\nC\\nA\\nD\\nSelf improvement\\nDistribution and \\ncollection of \\ninspection sheets\\nFeedback\\nSupport for \\nimprovement\\nP\\nC\\nA\\nD\\nP\\nC\\nA\\nD\\nWEB\\nCompliance (Sustainability Data Book 2019, p. 112)\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n38\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nFundamental Approach\\nThe origins of Toyota’s Customer First and Quality First \\nprinciples lie in the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, which \\nembody the thinking of Sakichi Toyoda, and the spirit of \\naudit and improvement espoused by Kiichiro Toyoda. \\nSince its foundation, Toyota has built a corporate culture \\nthat focuses particular attention on customer-pleasing \\nquality and continuous Kaizen (improvement) achieved \\nthrough Genchi Genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience). \\nIn accordance with our commitment to quality as stated \\nin the Toyota Global Vision, each employee in each field \\nmaintains a constant and strong awareness of issues \\nand a sense of ownership, striving to continuously imple\\xad\\nment Kaizen and collaborating closely with personnel in \\nother fields to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, \\nand satisfaction.\\nInitiatives to Improve Quality\\nToyota sees quality as the combination of product \\nquality, sales and service quality, and, as the founda\\xad\\ntion supporting these, the quality of the work performed \\nby each employee.\\n\\u2003 We believe that our products and services can only \\ngain the confidence of customers when all employees \\nacross every process, from development, purchasing, \\nproduction, and sales to after-sales service, build in \\nquality, coordinate with one another across process\\xad\\nes, and implement the quality assurance cycle.\\n\\u2003 Quality starts with the spirit of audit and improve\\xad\\nment. Through continuous improvement based on \\nrepeated implementation of the PDCA cycle, Toyota \\npursues ever-higher quality—this is the unchanging \\ncore of Toyota’s manufacturing.\\nCustomer First Measures\\nThe essence of Toyota’s principle of Customer First is \\nproviding customers with products and services that \\nbring smiles to their faces. Toyota aims to provide \\ncars that achieve superior environmental, safety, and \\nquality performance without sacrificing driving perfor\\xad\\nmance or other aspects of the intrinsic appeal of \\ncars, at an affordable price. We humbly and openly \\naccept information provided by our dealers and cus\\xad\\ntomer feedback received at customer assistance \\ncenters, taking such input to heart and utilizing it to \\nmake ever-better cars.\\nAfter-sales Services Measures\\nTo bring smiles to the faces of as many customers as \\npossible, it is essential to realize both better cars and \\nbetter services. Customer car use requires regular \\nservicing, inspections, and repairs following \\nbreakdowns or accidents. After-sales service provides \\nsafety, peace of mind, and comfort to customers at \\nthese times, supporting the Toyota and Lexus brands. \\n\\u2003 In recent years, the average duration of car use has \\nbeen lengthening. In fiscal 2019, the average length \\nof use of passenger vehicles in Japan (excluding \\nmini-vehicles) was 13.2 years, 1.6 years longer than \\na\\xa0decade earlier. Accordingly, the role of after-sales \\nservice is becoming increasingly important. More \\nthan 100 million Toyota vehicles are currently in use \\nworldwide, and each one is irreplaceable to a cus\\xad\\ntomer. Toyota strives to provide ever-better services \\nin accordance with the 3S Spirit (Seikaku + Shinsetsu \\n= Shinrai, meaning Accuracy + Caring = Trust) to \\nensure that customers will be highly satisfied with \\ntheir vehicles.\\nTraining Centers Develop Global Service Engineers\\nThe Tajimi Service Center provides training on vehicle servicing technologies and body repair and paint to service technicians \\nfrom dealers in Japan and distributors worldwide.\\nOpened in July 2013, the Tajimi Service Center is fully equipped \\nwith classrooms, practice areas, and drive evaluation courses \\nwith a variety of road conditions on a vast 187,000 m2 site. In fis\\xad\\ncal 2019, approximately 2,100 staff from 18 locations in Japan \\nand overseas trained at the center, bringing the center’s cumula\\xad\\ntive total number of training alumni to approximately 11,800.\\n\\u2003 Research and development of new technologies for the ser\\xad\\nvice, repair, and painting of new vehicles equipped with cut\\xad\\nting-edge technologies is also concentrated at the center. As a \\nglobal training facility, the center enables staff who come to the \\ncenter for training to improve their knowledge and skills, helping \\nbuild a solid foundation for reinforcing global competitiveness in \\nservice technology.\\nMaintaining Focus on the Series of Recall Issues\\nFebruary 24, the anniversary of the day that President Akio Toyoda attended U.S. Congressional hearings held to investigate the \\nseries of recall issues that occurred in 2010, has been designated Toyota Restart Day. We have created mechanisms and are \\ntaking measures to raise awareness in order to keep the lessons learned from the series of recall issues fresh.\\nCustomer Quality Learning Center \\nIn 2014, Toyota established the Customer Quality Learning Center \\nto convey the experiences and lessons learned from the series of \\nrecall issues to future generations of employees. With exhibits that \\nappeal to the five senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts \\nand vehicle simulators, these centers serve the important education\\xad\\nal role of conveying the circumstances surrounding the series of \\nissues. The content of the centers is updated every year to cover \\nthe most recent quality issues. Plants, including overseas plants, \\nhave also established their own Customer Quality Learning Center, \\nwhich they use to deepen understanding and spread awareness of \\nthe importance of quality among employees. \\nStorytelling Activities \\nEmployees who experienced the 2010 series of recall issues take \\non the role of storyteller to convey the facts and lessons learned \\nfrom those events at their own work sites. For Toyota Restart Day \\n2019, Chairman Uchiyamada served as a storyteller at a seminar \\nwhere he discussed his feeling of danger regarding the fading of \\nthe lessons learned from the series of recall issues. The seminar \\nhelped to boost storytelling activities, with participants comment\\xad\\ning that the seminar helped them understand the importance of \\ncommunicating feelings, rather than just knowledge, and that it \\nhelped renew a healthy sense of danger within them.\\nTajimi Service Center\\nWEB\\nCustomer First and Quality First Measures \\n(Sustainability Data Book 2019, p. 15)\\nCustomer First and Quality First Measures\\nTajimi Service Center\\nRegion\\nRegional affiliate/trading company\\nEurope, Africa, the Caribbean, \\nOceania, some Asian countries\\n(Outside the above regions/countries)\\n(Japan)\\nRegional affiliate/trading company\\nDistributors under regional affiliate\\nDistributors in \\neach country\\nDealers\\nDealers\\nDealers\\nImplementation by training alumni in each region/country\\nCountry\\nImplementation at the Tajimi Service Center\\nService Technology Training Process\\n\\u2002 Initiatives for Sustainable Growth\\u2003 \\x07\\nCorporate Philosophy\\u2003 Corporate Governance\\u2003 Messages from the Outside Directors\\u2003 Toyota Environmental Challenge\\u2003 Respect for Human Rights and SCM\\u2003 Employees\\u2003 Risk Management\\u2003 Compliance\\u2003 \\nCustomer First and Quality First\\u2003 Working to Better the World around Us\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\n39\\nTOYOTA Annual Report 2019\\nBased on a philosophy of contributing to society \\nthrough the manufacture of automobiles, Toyota \\nendeavors to contribute to sustainable development.\\n\\u2003 Toyota seeks to make ever-better cars in order \\nto bring happiness to customers. At the same time, \\nToyota implements a wide range of activities, such \\nas sponsoring sporting events—including the \\nOlympic Games and Paralympic Games—fostering \\ninitiatives related to mobility through the Toyota \\nMobility Foundation, and promoting social contri\\xad\\nbution activities. All of these efforts are aimed at \\nrealizing the mobility society of the future and \\nricher lifestyles.\\n\\u2003 Toyota will continue to contribute to the realiza\\xad\\ntion of a prosperous mobility society with greater \\nhappiness for all.\\nOlympic and Paralympic \\nWorldwide Partnerships\\nIn 2015, aiming to use sports to create a peaceful \\nand inclusive society and to use mobility to contribute \\nto the realization of a sustainable society, Toyota \\nformed a partnership with the International Olympic \\nCommittee (IOC) and International Paralympic \\nCommittee (IPC) in the areas of vehicles, mobility ser\\xad\\nvices, and mobility solutions, making it the first \\nWorldwide Olympic and Paralympic Partner in the \\nmobility category.\\n\\u2003 Through the Olympic and Paralympic Games, \\nToyota is aiming to achieve the following goals: “Ever \\nBetter MOBILITY FOR ALL,” “Ever Better SOCIETY” \\nand “Ever Better TOYOTA.” Toyota is carrying out \\n\\xad\\ninitiatives with the aim of realizing a society in which \\neveryone can participate and strive.\\n\\u2003 At the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 \\n(Tokyo 2020), Toyota aims to provide mobility solutions \\nthat go beyond its conventional framework of supplying \\nvehicles based on three pillars: 1. Mobility for all, \\n2.\\xa0Sustainability centered on the realization of a \\nhydrogen-powered society (environment and safety), \\nand 3. Transportation support leveraging the Toyota \\nProduction System (TPS) for those involved in \\nthe\\xa0games.\\nSpecific Measures\\nUsing its full line-up of electrified vehicles, Toyota will \\nreduce environmental impact while supporting smooth \\noperations at Tokyo 2020 through mobility solutions \\nthat combine the TPS with diverse forms of mobility.\\n\\u2003 Toyota will provide a total of around 3,700 vehicles \\nfor Tokyo 2020. Nearly 90 percent of these will be \\nelectrified vehicles, including the Mirai, a fuel cell vehi\\xad\\ncle (FCEV), and the Prius PHV (a plug-in hybrid vehi\\xad\\ncle, known as the Prius Prime in some markets), as \\nwell as such battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) \\nas the Accessible People Mover (APM), created spe\\xad\\ncifically for Tokyo 2020, and versions of the e-Palette \\nand LQ specifically designed for Tokyo 2020. Among \\nthe electrified vehicles provided will be approximately \\n500 FCEVs and 850 BEVs, for a total of approximately \\n1,350 vehicles that emit no CO2 during driving, the \\n\\xad\\nlargest such fleet at any Games to date.\\n\\u2003 By offering new ways of watching the Olympic and \\nParalympic Games and operational support using \\nrobots as well as mobility solutions that go beyond \\nconventional conceptions of mobility, Toyota is striv\\xad\\ning to provide freedom of movement for all, including \\nthose who, until now, have been unable to experience \\nthe Games.\\n\\u2003 For example, through communication and remote \\ncontrol via robots, guests in remote locations will be \\nable to interact with athletes and truly feel the atmo\\xad\\nsphere of the event as if they were there in person. In \\nfield events, we aim to help staff operate the Games \\nefficiently using field event support robots. \\nFurthermore, Toyota’s human support robot will offer \\nassistance to guests using wheelchairs to help them \\nto more freely enjoy the competition.\\nThe Toyota Mobility Foundation: Supporting \\nIdeas and Initiatives to Enrich Mobility\\nThe Toyota Mobility Foundation was established in \\nAugust 2014 to create a truly mobile society and help \\novercome the barriers to mobility for all. The founda\\xad\\ntion seeks to combine Toyota’s expertise with the \\ninnovative vision and experience of NPOs and \\nresearch organizations worldwide to solve mobility-\\xad\\nrelated issues and create a better mobility society.\\n\\u2003 Going forward, in addition to further improving its \\ncurrent projects, the foundation will leverage the \\nknow-how gained through its activities thus far to \\nadvance initiatives aimed at solving a wide range of \\nmobility issues.\\nTaking Our Founding Principle of Social \\nContribution Global\\nToyota has a long history of social contribution that \\ntraces back to the desire of Sakichi Toyoda—the \\nfather of Toyota Motor Corporation’s founder, Kiichiro \\nToyoda—to support inventions that would enrich \\npeople’s lives. Kiichiro and his team, who together \\nbuilt Toyota’s automotive business, kept this spirit of \\nsocial contribution alive after Sakichi’s death, espous\\xad\\ning the concepts of contributing to the development \\nand welfare of the country and remembering to \\nalways be grateful. These concepts were eventually \\nwoven into the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, the \\nGuiding Principles at Toyota, and the Toyota Global \\nVision. In these various forms, this spirit of social \\n\\xad\\ncontribution has been handed down to today.\\n\\u2003 In addition to contributions made through its busi\\xad\\nnesses, Toyota is pursuing social contribution in three \\ndesignated global priority fields: the environment,\\xad\\ntraffic safety, and education. We are also promoting \\nactivities in social, cultural, and other fields to meet \\nthe social needs of specific countries and regions, \\nutilizing our technologies, expertise, and other \\nresources to proactively advance initiatives. Going \\nforward, Toyota will continue striving to support \\n\\xad\\nvolunteering and to sustain automotive and manufac\\xad\\nturing cultures.\\nWorking to Better the World around Us\\n\\u2002

Annual Report 2019\\nMessage from the President\\nTransforming into a Mobility Company\\nInitiatives for Sustainable Growth\\nCorporate Data\\nTable of Contents\\nFinancial Services\\nToyota Financial Services Corporation provides finan\\xad\\ncial services, mainly auto loans and leasing, to more \\nthan 27,000,000 customers across its network, \\nwhich spans more than 35 countries and regions. In \\nfiscal 2018, the financial services business recorded \\nnet revenues of 2,153.5 billion yen and operating \\nincome of 322.8 billion yen.\\n\\u2003 Toyota’s financial services center mainly on sales \\nfinancing, which serves as a tool to promote car \\nsales. At the same time, we are working in new busi\\xad\\nness areas to realize a better future mobility society.\\n\\u2003 The basic role of the financial services business is \\nto enable more customers to use our cars. We do \\nour utmost to fulfill that role by promoting digitization, \\ndeveloping and offering new financial products, and \\nexpanding our network to countries where the \\n\\xad\\nautomotive market is growing. \\n\\u2003 Furthermore, with the automotive industry undergo\\xad\\ning major changes, we are implementing initiatives to \\nimprove customers’ lifestyles and the convenience of \\nsociety as a whole by expanding our value chain to \\ncreate added value through financial services across \\nthe car life cycle, from manufacture to disposal.\\n\\u2003 In Japan, KINTO Corporation was established and \\ncommenced operations. This new car provider sets \\nin motion the novel concept of owning and driving \\ncars on a monthly subscription basis. With the aim of \\nexpanding pan-European full-service leasing opera\\xad\\ntions, Toyota Fleet Mobility GmbH was established as \\na joint venture dedicated to expanding leasing services \\nin European countries. \\n\\u2003 Furthermore, Toyota is taking on the challenge of \\n\\xad\\nproviding innovative financial services with cutting-edge \\ntechnologies, building infrastructure for payments, \\nand working on blockchain technology. \\n\\u2003 Going forward, we will continue to develop and \\nprovide financial services in line with customer needs \\nand local market characteristics to help enrich \\n\\xad\\ncustomers’ lives.\\nHousing Services: Agreement to Establish Joint Venture with Panasonic Corporation in \\nTown Development Business\\nLifestyles are on the threshold of profound change \\ndue to the accelerated deployment of IoT technolo\\xad\\ngies in such areas as home appliances and house\\xad\\nhold equipment, as well as the evolution of mobility, \\nas exemplified by CASE and MaaS. The latter con\\xad\\nnects cars, public transportation, and other means of \\ntransportation through IT. From here on out, informa\\xad\\ntion links will connect all items and services that sup\\xad\\nport our daily lives. We must adopt a new, broader \\nperspective of the “connected city” that encompass\\xad\\nes the entire community and society, including cars. \\n\\u2003 To realize improvements in people’s lives while \\nseeking growth and advances in the town develop\\xad\\nment business, which is likely to see rapid change, \\nToyota and Panasonic signed an agreement in May \\n2019 to establish a new joint venture in the town \\ndevelopment business. Both companies aim to fuse \\nthe mobility services initiatives promoted by Toyota \\nand the “lifestyle updates” initiatives spearheaded by \\nPanasonic through collaboration based on the estab\\xad\\nlishment of the joint venture, thereby creating new \\nvalue for the town as a whole. Under this agreement, \\nToyota Housing Corporation, Misawa Homes Co., \\nLtd., and Panasonic Homes Co., Ltd., along with \\nPanasonic Construction Engineering Co., Ltd. and \\nMatsumura-gumi Corporation, which have construc\\xad\\ntion operations outside the scope of detached \\nhomes and other housing, will imbue the joint venture \\nwith new development functions that will be support\\xad\\ned with technologies from Toyota and Panasonic. \\n\\u2003 The joint venture will have three businesses: \\n\\xad\\nhousing, construction, and town development. \\nIn the housing business, the joint venture will have \\nindustry-leading competitiveness while leveraging the \\nunique advantages of three brands. In the construc\\xad\\ntion business, the aim is to provide a new type of \\nlabor-saving automated construction by leveraging the \\naccumulated manufacturing know-how of the parent \\ncompanies. In the town development business, the \\nobjective is to create tremendous new added value \\nthat supersedes conventional wisdom in real estate \\nvalue through advances in management and services. \\n\\u2003 Plans call for establishing the joint venture in January \\n2020.
